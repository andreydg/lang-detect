as if he were

to look for me when i
and made the best use of my
but presently i looked
himself in both arms
the marshes here and
were heavy or the tide was in
not nearly so broad nor yet
black and the sky was just
row of long angry red lines and
only two black things in all

it the other a gibbet
some chains hanging to it which had
held a pirate the man
limping on towards this latter as if
i thought so and as
saw the cattle lifting their heads
gaze after him i wondered whether
round for the horrible young man
but now i was frightened again and
she had brought me up by
knowing her to have a hard and
husband as well as
me i supposed that joe gargery and
not a good looking woman my
must have made joe
marry her by hand
his smooth face and with eyes
seemed to have somehow got mixed with
sort of hercules in strength and also
that i sometimes used to
whether it was possible she washed
she was tall and bony

was shut up and
was sitting alone in
and having confidences as

the latch of the door

after that he sat
his right side flaxen curls and
bib —where it sometimes got
pin into it and sometimes a needle
an apothecary kind of way as if
of the knife with a slapping dexterity
round the crust then
gave the knife a final smart
on the edge of
two halves of which joe
present occasion though i was hungry
i must have something in reserve
mrs joe s housekeeping to be of
strictest kind and that my
the safe therefore i resolved
put my hunk of bread
the effort of resolution necessary to the
of this purpose i found to be
to leap from the top of a
house or plunge into a
freemasonry as fellow sufferers and in
good natured companionship with me it
the way we bit
friendly competition but he found
on one knee and
last i desperately considered that the
i contemplated must be done
that it had best be done
the least improbable manner

made uncomfortable by what he supposed to
it about in his mouth much longer
like a pill he was
had just got his
on one side for

what s the matter
said she smartly as she put
her cup i say

me up by the hair saying

beast had revived tar water in
days as a fine medicine and mrs

judging from myself i should say he
man or boy but
in the case of

as i can testify a great
the guilty knowledge that i was going
rob mrs joe—i never thought
and butter as i sat or when
errand almost drove me out
my mind then as the
his leg who had sworn me
must be fed now at other
i thought what if the young man
was with so much difficulty restrained
should yield to a
impatience or should mistake
end with terror mine must
done so then but perhaps
s ever did it was christmas eve
i had to stir the pudding for
day with a copper
the load on his
bring the bread and butter out
when i had done my stirring
was taking a final
escaped escaped administering the
like tar water while mrs joe
with her head bending over
aloud after sunset gun and they fired

re firing warning of
he is ask no questions
it was not very
ask questions but she
was polite unless there was company at
his mouth very wide
to mrs joe and put
but joe wouldn t hear of that
very wide and shook the form of
most emphatic word out of it but
i should like to know—if
from lord bless the
exclaimed my sister as if she didn
s the way with this boy exclaimed
at me answer him
you a dozen directly hulks
prison ships right cross th
quiet desperation it was too much for
hand to badger people s lives out
would be blame to
and not praise if i
sorts of bad and
always begin by asking
now you get along
as i went up stairs in
for me i was clearly on
way there i had begun
asking questions and i
mortal terror of my interlocutor with the
have done on requirement in the
trumpet as i passed the
and not put it off
was afraid to sleep even if i
i must rob the pantry there was
doing it in the
got one i must have
after me stop thief and get up
i was very much
about half a jar of mincemeat which
with my last night s slice some
from a stone bottle which
fluid spanish liquorice water up
nearly going away without the pie but
shelf to look what it was
and i took it in the
use and would not be missed for
communicating with the forge i unlocked
rimy morning and very damp i had
the damp lying on the outside
goblin had been crying
all night and using the
the damp lying on the
blade on every rail and gate
lay clammy and the marsh
was so thick that the wooden
never came there—was invisible to me
it then as i looked
conscience like a phantom devoting me
the hulks the mist was heavier
seemed to run at me this was
disagreeable to a guilty mind the gates
dikes and banks came bursting
a boy with somebody
young thief one black
to my awakened conscience something of
clerical air —fixed me
obstinately with his eyes and
it upon which he put
his head blew a cloud
river but however fast i went i
cold seemed riveted as the iron was
to the leg of the
i was running to meet i knew
way to the battery pretty straight for
had told me that when
bound we would have
larks there however in the
of the mist i found myself
of loose stones above the mud and
my way along here with all
i had just crossed a
man sitting before me
back was towards me and he had
forward heavy with sleep i thought he
upon him with his breakfast in that
manner so i went forward softly and
him on the shoulder he instantly jumped
too and had a
and hoarse and cold and
moment to see it in he
that missed me and almost knocked
then he ran into the mist
lost him it s the young
i thought feeling my heart shoot
i should have felt a
in my liver too if
—hugging himself and limping to and
as if he had
all night left off
and limping —waiting for me he
awfully cold to be sure i
expected to see him drop down before
he would have tried to eat
if he had not
get at what i had but
the bottle boy said he brandy said
it away somewhere in a violent hurry
—but he left off
the while so violently that it was
without biting it off i think
the meshes and they re dreadful aguish
if i was going
was gobbling mincemeat meatbone bread cheese and
pie all at once staring
while he did so at the
or fancied sound some
beast upon the marsh now gave him
re not a deceiving
you brought no one with you no
no nor giv no
well said he i believe
as near death and
over his eyes pitying
desolation and watching him as
gradually settled down upon the pie
enjoy it did you speak i said
was glad you enjoyed
watched a large dog
ours eating his food
too soon and too
and he looked sideways here
there was danger in every direction of
comfortably i thought or to have anybody
his jaws at the visitor
him who s him said my friend
that was hid with
oh ah he returned with something like
don t want no wittles i thought
looked as if he did
i the man stopped eating and
me with the keenest
by the collar and stared at
think his first idea about cutting my
with a hat i explained trembling and—and
was very anxious to put this
that i returned for
when a man s alone on
flats with a light head
night but guns firing and
calling hears he sees the
up by the torches carried afore
hears himself challenged hears the rattle
cover him steady men and is
order damn em with their
as if he had
in him he had a badly
face said i recalling what i
knew i knew not here
the man striking his left
mercilessly with the flat of
hand yes there where is
was left into the breast of his
i ll pull him down
sore leg give us hold
the mist had shrouded the
man and he looked up at it
an instant but he was
than the file i
into this fierce hurry and
of keeping away from home any longer
told him i must go
could do was to slip off the
i saw of him his head
at it and at
no discovery had yet
made of the robbery
joe was prodigiously busy
put upon the kitchen
reaping the floors of
establishment and where the deuce
you been was mrs joe
christmas salutation when i and my conscience
ourselves i said i
been down to hear the
ah well observed mrs joe you might
done worse not a
of that i thought perhaps if i
t a blacksmith s wife
a slave with her apron never
said mrs joe i m rather
to carols myself and
after me as the dustpan
at him and when her
as our token that mrs joe
weeks together be as
our fingers like monumental
mincemeat not being missed and the pudding
already on the boil these extensive
occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously
respect of breakfast for
forced march instead of a
gulps of milk and water with
countenances from a jug on the dresser
the meantime mrs joe put
white curtains up and tacked
new flowered flounce across the wide chimney
replace the old one and uncovered the
four little white crockery poodles
other mrs joe was a
exquisite art of making her cleanliness
going to church vicariously that is to
his working—clothes joe was a well
characteristic looking blacksmith in
to him and everything
he wore then grazed him on
in a full suit of
young offender whom an accoucheur policeman
taken up on my birthday
delivered over to her
of the law i was always treated
best friends even when i was
a moving spectacle for
nothing to what i underwent within the
or out of the room were only
my hands had done
the weight of my
from the vengeance of the
young man if i
for me to rise and
a private conference in the vestry
mr wopsle the clerk at church was
dine with us and
got home we found the table
and the front door unlocked
never was at any other
for the company to enter
and everything most splendid and still
and the company came mr
a large shining bald forehead
give him his head
our clerk but he punished the amens
psalm —always giving the whole
—he looked all round the
i opened the door
the company —making believe
it was a habit of ours
open that door —and i
i was not allowed to call him
under the severest penalties mrs
a fish dull staring eyes
that he looked as if he had
have brought you as the compliments of
sherry wine—and i have
a profound novelty with exactly the same
and carrying the two bottles
dumb bells every christmas
o un—cle pum ble—chook this is kind
nuts and oranges and apples
the parlor which was
change from his working
hubble as a little curly
edged person in sky
position because she had married mr hubble
she was much younger than he
apart so that in my
days i always saw some miles of
him coming up the lane among this
the pantry in a false position not
the table in my chest and the
speak i didn t want to
no i should not
now and then and stick the point
little bull in a
up by these moral
it began the moment we
down to dinner mr
said grace with theatrical declamation —as it
of the ghost in hamlet with
the third —and ended with
might be truly grateful upon which
said in a low reproachful voice do
hear that be grateful especially said
contemplating me with a
to no good asked
is it that the
naterally wicious everybody then murmured true and
manner joe s station and influence were
feebler if possible when there was company
when there was none but he
some way of his
and he always did
gravy if there were any there
with some severity and
church being thrown open —what kind of
discourse he remarked that he considered
subject of the day
he added when there were so
subjects going about true again said
subjects going about for them
know how to put salt upon their
that s what s wanted a man
t go far to
a subject if he
after a short interval of reflection look
pork alone there s
subject if you want a
look at pork true sir many a
going to lug me in
he said it might be deduced from
parenthesis joe gave me some more gravy
pursued mr wopsle in his
voice and pointing his
at my blushes as if he
mentioning my christian name — swine
swine is put before us as
hubble of course or girl
hubble assented mr wopsle rather irritably
think what you ve got to
grateful for if you d been born
joe gave me some
a four footed squeaker said
born such would you have been here
not you— unless in
t mean in that form sir returned
and betters and improving himself with
luxury would he have
would have been your
the article and dunstable the
would have whipped you under his
arm and with his
had your life no bringing up
afraid to take he was
sister trouble and then entered on a
catalogue of all the illnesses i
been guilty of and all the
had tumbled from and all the low
in my grave and i
to pull it until he howled but
i had endured up
with the awful feelings
took possession of me when the pause
everybody had looked at
as i felt painfully conscious
leading the company gently back to the
pork—regarded as biled—is rich
ain t it have a little
uncle said my sister o
would say it was weak and i
lost i held tight to
leg of the table under the cloth
sister went for the stone
taking any the wretched man trifled with
glass —took it up looked at it
table for the pie and pudding
off him always holding tight by the
of the table with
head back and drink the brandy off
afterwards the company were seized with
consternation owing to his springing to
feet turning round several times in an
apparently out of his mind
t know how i had
relief when he was brought
and surveying the company all round as
his chair with the one significant gasp
i had filled up the bottle
like a medium of the present
why how ever could tar
there but uncle pumblechook
was omnipotent in that
had begun to be alarmingly meditative
to employ herself actively in
mixing them for the time
i still held on to the
of the table but clutched it now
the fervor of gratitude
partake of pudding mr pumblechook partook of
all partook of pudding the course terminated
beam under the genial influence of gin
water i began to think
should get over the day when my
youth and friend of my
i really was gone you
must they let them not hope
taste it you must know
all things considered — well
in the roman nostrils of mr wopsle
have some pip i have never been
certain whether i uttered
in the bodily hearing
the company i felt that i could
but i ran no farther than
house door for there
held out a pair of handcuffs to
saying here you are
but ends of their loaded muskets
our door step caused the
party to rise from table in confusion
empty handed to stop short
stare in her wondering lament of gracious
gracious me what s gone—with the—pie
sergeant and i were in
kitchen when mrs joe
use of my senses it
and he was now looking round at
company with his handcuffs invitingly extended
them in his right hand
and gentleman said the sergeant but as
smart young shaver which he hadn
the name of the king
i want the blacksmith and pray what
my sister quick to resent his being
at all missis returned the
of his fine wife s
little job done this was
as rather neat in
sergeant insomuch that mr pumblechook cried audibly
again you see blacksmith
time picked out joe with
and i find the lock
one of em goes wrong and the
don t act pretty as
threw his eye over them and
that the job would
the lighting of his forge fire
and if my men can
a hand anywhere they ll
themselves useful with that he called to
stood about as soldiers do now with
hands loosely clasped before them
or a pouch now opening
stocks out into the
better of the pie as to
more of my scattered wits would you
pumblechook as to a
course way ay returned
the marshes still and they won
try to get clear
with confidence nobody thought of me well
blacksmith if you re ready his majesty
waistcoat and cravat off and his
apron on and passed into the
one of the soldiers opened
wooden windows another lighted the fire another
stood round the blaze which
soon roaring then joe began
and we all looked on
interest of the impending
not only absorbed the general attention
even made my sister liberal
to take a glass of
wine mum i ll engage
s no tar in that so the
his drink without tar
would take wine if it was
of the season and
and smacked his lips
ll tell you something returned the sergeant
suspect that stuff s
the shoulder you re a man
ye think so said mr pumblechook
to the top of mine —ring
quite ready for another glass i
that mr pumblechook in his
appeared to forget that he had made
called for the other bottle and
that about with the
watched them while they all
when the bellows seemed to roar for
the smoke to hurry away
hammer and clink for them and all
shake at them in menace as the
rose and sank and the
hot sparks dropped and died the pale
outside almost seemed in my pitying young
to have turned pale on their
hunt mr pumblechook and mr hubble declined
society but mr wopsle said
joe said he was agreeable and would
know all about it and how
if you bring the boy
to me to put
from mr pumblechook as from a
were quite as fully sensible of that
their muskets and fell in mr
joe and i received strict
in the raw air and were
find them and joe whispered to me
d give a shilling if they
and threatening the way dreary the
people had good fires
doors and were keeping the day a
faces hurried to glowing windows and looked
us but none came out we passed
the churchyard there we were stopped a
or three of his
in again without finding
on the open marshes
a bitter sleet came rattling
us here on the east wind
now that we were out
hiding i considered for the first time
great dread if we
come upon them would my particular convict
brought the soldiers there he
asked me if i was a deceiving
believe that i was
the soldiers were in front of us
mist either the mist was not
glare of sunset the
with my heart thumping
the convicts i could see
more than once by his
and could dissociate them from
when i thought i
in their eating and looked timidly at
and the shudder of the
of the marshes the soldiers were moving
in the direction of the old
way behind them when all of
sudden we all stopped for there had
towards the east but it was long
loud nay there seemed to
two or more shouts raised together
one might judge from a
the sergeant a decisive man
that the sound should not
answered but that the course should
changed and that his men
make towards it at the double
we slanted to the right where the
wonderfully that i had
was a run indeed now and what
a winder down banks
splashing into dikes and breaking among
rushes no man cared where he
it became more and
than one voice sometimes it
to stop altogether and
out again the soldiers made for it
a greater rate than ever and
could hear one voice calling murder
another voice convicts runaways
then both voices would seem to
we all ran in here are
the bottom of a ditch surrender
were being sworn and blows
being struck when some
men went down into the
to help the sergeant and dragged out
course i knew them both directly mind
my convict wiping blood from
face with his ragged sleeves and shaking
i don t expect it
do me any good i don t
it to do me more good
it does now said my convict with
the other convict was livid to look
get his breath to speak until
were both separately handcuffed but leaned upon
first words tried to
not do it i took him and
him up that s what i
here —dragged him this far on
worse and drag him back
sergeant single handed i got clear of
of these death cold flats likewise—look
t made the discovery that
was here let him
the means as i
no if i had died at the
emphatic swing at the ditch with his
hands i d have
at his face ain t it
there let him turn
eyes of his on
the other with an effort at a
nervous working of his mouth into any
expression looked at the soldiers
the sky but certainly
you see him pursued my convict do
see what a villain
is do you see
grovelling and wandering eyes
never looked at me the
always working and working
at the bound hands at that point
convict became so frantically
but for the interposition of the soldiers
his lips curious white flakes like
sergeant light those torches as one of
soldiers who carried a basket in
the brink of the ditch when
moved since i looked
him eagerly when he looked
i might try to assure him
my innocence it was
look that i did not
and it all passed in
looked at me for an
or for a day i
as having been more attentive the soldier
the basket soon got
it seemed quite dark and soon
very dark before we departed from that
distance behind us and others on
ahead of us with a
sergeant to my convict they know you
and each walked surrounded by
separate guard i had hold of joe
hand now and joe carried one
reasonably good path now mostly on
edge of the river with
a dike came with a miniature windmill
i looked round i could see
other lights coming in after
nothing else but black darkness our
midst of the muskets we
came to a rough wooden hut
a landing place there was a guard
the hut and they challenged and the
answered then we went into
an overgrown mangle without the
dozen soldiers all at once three or
coats were not much interested
and took a sleepy stare
then lay down again
sergeant made some kind of report and
go on board first
convict never looked at me
the hut he stood before
suddenly he turned to
may prevent some persons laying
suspicion alonger me you can say
took some wittles up at the
a most out on the marshes you
ll tell you where from from
sergeant staring at joe halloa pip said
staring at me it
some broken wittles—that s what
have you happened to
such an article as a pie
did at the very moment when
pie god knows you re
to it —so far
it was ever mine returned
we don t know what
have done but we wouldn t have
starved to death for it poor
clicked in the man s throat again
he turned his back the boat
we followed him to the landing place

established sciences soc groups primarily
talk groups largely debate oriented and
to feature long discussions without resolution
without appreciable amounts of
recreational activities these ``world newsgroups are
circulated around the entire usenet

entirely cooperative feeds are generally provided out

for the large part no exchange
over the internet with uucp news is
in batches on a site until

the neighbor wishes to receive is maintained
nntp on the other hand offers a
more latitude with how news
though other methods have
devised programs now keep
connections with their news neighbors
news nearly instantaneously and can handle

in town in a body for they
stood in the vestibule sucking their cane
and simpering admirers till the last girl
as if she were cut glass

had been thrown up
them so much his white handkerchief was
out of his pocket
upon boys who had

the minister prayed a
generous prayer it was and
the church for the other churches

grateful harvest of good amen
was a rustling of dresses
the standing congregation sat down
through it he kept tally
of new matter was interlarded
by calmly rubbing its hands together embracing
head with its arms and
view scraping its wings with its
legs and smoothing them to its body
if they had been
tails going through its whole toilet as
as if it knew it was perfectly
sorely as tom s hands itched
he believed his soul would be
destroyed if he did such a
while the prayer was going on
amen was out the

his text and droned along monotonously
an argument that was so prosy
was really interested for a
and moving picture of the
at the millennium when
and a little child should
great spectacle were lost upon the
he only thought of the
of the principal character before the on
thought and he said to
that he wished he
was a tame lion now he
with formidable jaws a pinchbug he
box the first thing the beetle
was to take him by the finger
floundering into the aisle and lit on
to turn over tom eyed
idling along sad at heart lazy
missing it made another
head nodded and little by
the enemy who seized it there was
head and the beetle
a couple of yards away and lit
its back once more the neighboring
shook with a gentle inward joy
faces went behind fans and
but there was resentment
so he went to the
jumping at it from every point
an inch of the creature
after a while tried to
wearied of that yawned sighed forgot
the poodle went sailing up the
the yelps continued and so did the
clamored up the home stretch
frantic sufferer sheered from its course and
into its master s lap
voice of distress quickly thinned away and
had come to a
went lame and halting all possibility
impressiveness being at an
it was a genuine
to the whole congregation when the
was over and the
pronounced tom sawyer went home
in it he had but one
play with his pinchbug but he did
him to carry it off chapter vi
began another week s slow suffering
school he generally began that day
wishing he had had no intervening
him that he wished he
sick then he could stay home
was found and he investigated again
time he thought he could detect
he reflected further suddenly he discovered something
of his upper front teeth
loose this was lucky he was about
begin to groan as a
occurred to him that if he came
would pull it out and
thing that laid up a
for two or three weeks and
so the boy eagerly drew his
and held it up for inspection
now he did not
spirit but sid slept on unconscious
to feel pain in the
took a rest and
swelled himself up and fetched a succession
admirable groans sid snored on tom was
he said sid sid and shook him
course worked well and tom began
groan again sid yawned
at tom tom went on groaning sid
tom say tom no response here
and he shook him and looked in
face anxiously tom moaned out
don t sid don t joggle
this way hours ouch
me tom why didn
you wake me sooner oh tom
sid groan everything you ve ever
that s come to town
tell her but sid had snatched his
and gone tom was
in reality now so handsomely was
imagination working and so
t believe it but
mary at her heels and
down into a chair and laughed
you shut up that nonsense and
out of this the
ceased and the pain vanished
indeed what s the matter with your
one of them s loose and it
perfectly awful there there
to die about that
get me a silk thread
a chunk of fire out of the
and go a fishing tom tom
break my old heart
of the silk thread fast
she seized the chunk
fire and suddenly thrust
almost into the boy s face the
hung dangling by the
now but all trials bring their
met because the gap
one that had cut
finger and had been a centre of
time now found himself suddenly without
was heavy and he
with a disdain which
sour grapes and he wandered away
dreaded by all the mothers of
town because he was
and lawless and vulgar and bad and
and delighted in his forbidden society
wished they dared to be like
tom was like the rest of
gaudy outcast condition and
play with him so
grown men and they
with rags his hat was a
out of its brim his
to his heels and had
rearward buttons far down
in the dirt when not
up huckleberry came and went at
in wet he did
have to go to school

see it tom got out a bit
tom lifted his lip and showed the
well all right said huckleberry it
pinchbug s prison and the
when tom reached the little isolated frame
he strode in briskly with the
of one who had come with all
a peg and flung himself into his
roused him thomas sawyer tom
that when his name was pronounced
down a back that he recognized
and by that form
the only vacant place on
talk with huckleberry finn the master
you did what stopped to talk
listened to no mere
arm performed until it was tired and
the order followed now sir go and
the boy but in reality that
was caused rather more by his worshipful
the long low desk before him and
to study his book
once more presently the boy began
steal furtive glances at the girl she
away tom gently put it back she
it away again but with
animosity tom patiently returned it to its
the girl glanced at the words
made no sign now the boy
but the boy did not betray
he was aware of it
last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered
me see it tom
uncovered a dismal caricature
then whispered it s nice
the house but the girl was
hypercritical she was satisfied with the
the girl said it s
ll stay if you
sawyer that s the name
will you yes now tom began to
from the girl but
to see yes i do
live no i won t
tell anybody now let me
you don t want to
now that you treat me
i will see and
little scuffle ensued tom
letting his hand slip by degrees till
smart rap but reddened
over him during a few awful moments
throne without saying a word but
tom s ear tingled his heart
an honest effort to study but
turmoil within him was
great in turn he
in the geography class and turned lakes
a succession of mere baby words
vii the harder tom tried to
his mind on his book the
his ideas wandered so
last with a sigh and a
he gave it up
recess would never come the
the drowsing murmur of the
the soul like the spell that
in the flaming sunshine cardiff
in the air no other living
heart ached to be
or else to have
of interest to do to
the dreary time his hand wandered into
tick and put him on
long flat desk the creature probably
aside with a pin and
him take a new direction
him suffering just as
friends all the week
pin out of his lapel
the prisoner the sport grew in interest
soon tom said that they were interfering
each other and neither
he put joe s slate on the
the middle of it from
to bottom now said he as long
he is on your side you
stir him up and i ll let
alone but if you let
get away and get
my side you re
can keep him from
the tick escaped from
joe harassed him awhile
again this change of base occurred often
interest the other would look on
interest as strong the two heads
together over the slate and the two
dead to all things
at last luck seemed to
and abide with joe the
the boys themselves but time and again
would be twitching to begin joe
out and lent a hand
him alone i only just want
ain t going to stir
much let him alone
tell you i won t you
he s on my side of
line look here joe harper whose is
line and you sha n t touch
though he s my
on tom s shoulders and its duplicate
and the whole school
down the room and stood over
he had contemplated a
when school broke up at
tom flew to becky thatcher and
in her ear put on your bonnet
you get to the corner give the
it over em the same
with another in a
they sat together with a
before them and tom
becky the pencil and held
interest in art began
wane the two fell to
much anyway what i like is
gum oh i should
that was agreeable so they chewed it
a circus there s things going on
a circus all the
and they get slathers of money most
was you ever engaged what s
why engaged to be married no
i don t know what is
and then you kiss and that s
why yes everybody that s in love
wrote on the slate
ye yes but some other time
now no not now to morrow oh
passed his arm about her waist and
the tale ever so softly with his
face away so you
she bent timidly around
sprang away and ran around
little white apron to her
all done all over
by and by she gave
face all glowing with the struggle came
red lips and said now it
after this you know you ain
anybody but me ever
and forever will you no i ll
love anybody but you
marry anybody but me either certainly of
home you re to walk with me
at parties because that
oh it s ever so gay why
stopped confused oh tom then i
t the first you ve ever
engaged to the child began to
tom said oh don t cry becky
more yes you do tom you know
but she pushed him
and turned her face to
about restless and uneasy
repent and come to find him
she did not then he began
feel badly and fear that he was
new advances now but he nerved himself
it and entered she was
corner sobbing with her face
smote him he went
her and stood a moment
for anybody but you no
see it and said
becky won t you take
she struck it to the floor
far away to return to
no more that day
door he was not in sight
flew around to the play
intently but there was
answer she had no companions but silence
again and upbraid herself and by this
the scholars began to gather
of a long dreary aching afternoon
tom dodged hither and
baffled pursuit half an hour later he
away off in the valley behind him
spot under a spreading oak there
not even a zephyr stirring
dead noonday heat had even
a trance that was
silence and sense of
the more profound the
sat long with his elbows on
knees and his chin in his
meditating it seemed to him that
thought to lie and slumber
the grass and the flowers over
about ever any more
he only had a
sunday school record he
this girl what had he done
he had meant the best in
world and been treated like a dog
long at a time
concerns of this life
what if he turned
back now and disappeared mysteriously
beyond the seas and never
back any more how
an offense when they intruded
vague august realm of the romantic no
would be a soldier and return
and illustrious no better
trackless great plains of the far
and away in the future
this he would be a pirate
was it now his
the world and make
shudder how gloriously he
go plowing the dancing seas in his
spirit of the storm with his
sash his belt bristling with
his black flag unfurled with the skull
crossbones on it and hear with
tom sawyer the pirate
black avenger of the spanish main yes
home and enter upon it
a rotten log near at hand and
it with his barlow
he soon struck wood that
this incantation impressively what hasn t come
and sides were of shingles in it
a marble tom s astonishment
boundless he scratched his head with
beats anything then he tossed the
which he and all his
had always looked upon
infallible if you buried
marble with certain necessary incantations and
place with the incantation
gathered themselves together there meantime no
unquestionably failed tom s whole structure of
a time heard of this
hiding places afterward he puzzled
a little funnel shaped depression in it
laid himself down and put his
small black bug appeared for a
was a witch that
it i just knowed it
that he might as well have
marble he had just thrown away
patient search for it but
could not find it now he went
to his treasure house
marble away then he took another marble
his pocket and tossed
brother go find your
he watched where it
and went there and looked but it
of a toy tin trumpet came
his jacket and trousers turned a suspender
the rotten log disclosing a
seized these things and bounded away barelegged
fluttering shirt he presently halted
a great elm blew an answering
and then began to tiptoe
look warily out this way
hold my merry men
hid till i blow now appeared joe
into sherwood forest without my
man s pass who art thou that
prompting for they talked
the book from memory who
indeed that famous outlaw right gladly
merry wood have at thee
lively so they went
lively panting and perspiring with the work
it why that ain t anything i
t fall that ain t
way it is in
book the book says then with
back handed stroke he slew
guy of guisborne you re to turn
whack and fell now said
me kill you that s fair
the miller s son and lam
ll be the sheriff of
while and kill me
was satisfactory and so these
joe representing a whole tribe
weeping outlaws dragged him sadly
the greenwood tree then he
the arrow and fell back
wondering what modern civilization could
to have done to compensate
would rather be outlaws
at half past nine that
usual they said their prayers and
was soon asleep tom lay awake and
in restless impatience when it
despair he would have tossed and fidgeted
afraid he might wake sid so
lay still and stared up
noises began to emphasize themselves the ticking
the clock began to bring itself into
old beams began to crack mysteriously the
abroad a measured muffled snore issued
meant that somebody s
far off dog rose on
distance tom was in an
not hear it and then there
you devil and the
jumped to the roof
finn was there with his
cat the boys moved off and
it was a graveyard of the
about a mile and
upright nowhere grass and weeds grew rank
on the place round topped worm
boards staggered over the graves leaning
and so had been painted on them
but it could no longer have
been light a faint
of the dead complaining at being disturbed
boys talked little and
under their breath for the time
the place and the pervading solemnity and
heap they were seeking and
three great elms that grew in a
within a few feet of the
then they waited in
of a distant owl was
grew oppressive he must
some talk so he said
people like it for us to be

had reached the grave
of the boys hiding place
lantern up and revealed the
of young doctor robinson potter and
and a couple of shovels

but the grating sound of the
discharging their freight of mould and
upon the coffin with
two the men had hoisted it out
lid with their shovels got out the
and dumped it rudely
pallid face the barrow
covered with a blanket
the rope potter took out a
spring knife and cut off the
end of the rope and then
what does this mean
the doctor you required your
your father s kitchen one
when i come to ask for
to eat and you said i

even with you if it took

he was threatening the
by this time the doctor
my pard and the next moment
felled potter to the
with it and in the
his chance and drove the knife to
s breast he reeled
fell partly upon potter flooding him
his blood and in the same
the clouds blotted out the
spectacle and the two frightened
went speeding away in
dark presently when the moon
again injun joe was
over the two forms contemplating them
doctor murmured inarticulately gave a
fatal knife in potter s open
hand and sat down on the dismantled
and then potter began
him confusedly his eyes

i never done it look

yonder way and i ll go this
now and don t leave any
he muttered if he s as much
the open grave were under
inspection but the moon s
horror they glanced backward over
as if they feared
they sped by some outlying
that lay near the village the
of the aroused watch dogs
to give wings to their
if we can only get to the
tannery before we break down whispered
in short catches between
much longer huckleberry s hard pantings were
eyes on the goal of
hopes and bent to
on it and at last breast
breast they burst through the
door and fell grateful and exhausted
the sheltering shadows beyond
whispered huckleberry what do

tom thought a while then he said

in time after many
tom managed to sign his initials using

through a break in

rose up strong again and
understanding that they would take to their
if the snoring stopped so
moonlight it was muff potter the
away now they tiptoed out through the
parting word that long lugubrious howl
turned and saw the strange dog
potter was lying and facing potter with
a breath say tom
say a stray dog come
around johnny miller s house
on the banisters and sung
very same evening and
i know that and suppose
s getting better too all right
these kind of things huck
his bedroom window the night
almost spent he undressed
excessive caution and fell asleep congratulating himself
sid was awake and
there was a late
in the light a late sense in
atmosphere he was startled why had
not been called persecuted till he
up as usual the thought
minutes he was dressed and
family were still at table but
rebuke but there were averted
and tried to seem gay
it was up hill work
and he lapsed into
the depths after breakfast his aunt
him aside and tom almost brightened in
was not so his aunt wept over
and asked him how he could go
break her old heart so and
for it was no use
was sorer now than his body he
too miserable to even feel revengeful toward
retreat through the back gate was unnecessary
joe harper for playing hookey
dead to trifles then he betook himself
stony stare of suffering that
a long time he slowly
sadly changed his position and took up
was in a paper he unrolled
a long lingering colossal sigh followed and
heart broke it was his brass
knob this final feather broke
electrified with the ghastly
to man from group
had not a gory knife had
found close to the murdered man and
belated citizen had come upon
the morning and that potter had
which was not a habit with
are not slow in the matter of
verdict but that he could
be found horsemen had departed down all
was drifting toward the
tom s heartbreak vanished and
him an age since
turned and his eyes met huckleberry
was talking and intent
here now tom shivered
head to heel for his
joe at this moment
crowd began to sway and
tom s head said he wasn t
to get away he only
doubtful and perplexed infernal impudence
quiet look at his work i
came through ostentatiously leading potter by
arm the poor fellow s
palsy and he put his face in
done it who s accused you shouted
voice this shot seemed
thrust before him by the
and get he shuddered then waved
then huckleberry and tom stood dumb
and wondering to see how long the
their wavering impulse to
their oath and save the poor
prisoner s life faded and vanished
fatal to meddle with the
for somebody said i couldn t help
i couldn t help it potter moaned
boys seeing that the lightnings were
the devil he was now become
them the most balefully interesting object they
the hope of getting a
helped to raise the
was whispered through the shuddering crowd that
were disappointed for more than one
remarked it was within three feet
s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed
keep me awake half
it s a bad sign said
s blood that s what it is
you ll tell everything was swimming before
now but luckily the concern passed out
aunt polly s face and she came
tom s relief without knowing it
said sho it s that
dream it s me
been affected much the same way sid
satisfied tom got out of
after that he complained of toothache for
while at a time
place again tom s
and the toothache grew irksome and was
if sid really managed to
anything out of tom s disjointed
sid did not overlook the
that tom even showed a
torture tom s conscience every day or
tom watched his opportunity and
to the little grated jail
and smuggled such small comforts
to the murderer as he
get hold of the jail was
trifling little brick den that stood
and no guards were afforded for it
it was seldom occupied these offerings
helped to ease tom s conscience the
and feather injun joe and ride
but so formidable was
character that nobody could be found who
willing to take the lead in
grave robbery that preceded it therefore it
the courts at present chapter
one of the reasons why tom s
had drifted away from its secret troubles
thatcher had stopped coming to
whistle her down the wind but failed
began to find himself
took an interest in war nor
in piracy the charm of life
gone there was nothing but dreariness left
his aunt was concerned she began to
one of those people who are infatuated
patent medicines and all
mending it she was an
health periodicals and phrenological frauds and the
ignorance they were inflated with
to go to bed and how
get up and what to
s self in and what
of clothing to wear was all gospel
month customarily upset everything
she was as simple hearted and
quack medicines and thus
never suspected that she was
an angel of healing and the balm
gilead in disguise to the suffering neighbors
water treatment was new
a windfall to her she had
out at daylight every
woodshed and drowned him
put him away under blankets till she
of it came through his
as tom said yet
all this the boy
dejected she added hot
sitz baths shower baths and plunges the
remained as dismal as a
she began to assist
plasters she calculated his capacity as she
up every day with quack cure
tom had become indifferent to persecution
this time this phase filled the old
must be broken up
the water treatment and everything else
pinned her faith to pain killer
gave tom a teaspoonful and watched
the boy could not
that it was time
little sentiment and too
distracting variety about it so he
be fond of pain killer
he became a nuisance and
aunt ended by telling him to
been sid she would have had
since it was tom she watched
medicine did really diminish but it
tom was in the
of dosing the crack when his aunt
you want it peter but peter

made cups of broad oak
water sweetened with such a wildwood
as that would be a
enough substitute for coffee while
time to get impatient before they were
a small catfish provisions
so delicious before they did
fresh water fish is on the fire
he is caught the better

upon what a sauce open air sleeping
while huck had a smoke and then
they tramped gayly along
ground with a drooping regalia
with but nothing to be
at they discovered that the island
the shore it lay closest to
narrow channel hardly two hundred
wide they took a swim about
of the afternoon when they got
cold ham and then
to drag and then died

clock which he takes no distinct

came floating down out of the distance
his breath i wonder said
in a whisper tain

t talk they waited a time that
an age and then the
muffled boom troubled the
hush let s go
see they sprang to
people there were a
many skiffs rowing about or
it expanded and rose in
sound was borne to the listeners again
know now exclaimed tom somebody s drownded
s it said huck they done
to the top yes and
take loaves of bread and
quicksilver in em and set em
and wherever there s anybody that s
yes i ve heard about that

us they felt like
gorgeous triumph they were missed they were
the departed were the
of the whole town
after all as twilight
jubilant with vanity over their new
caught fish cooked supper and ate it
look upon from their point of view
wandering elsewhere the excitement was gone
and tom and joe
not keep back thoughts
as they were misgivings came
not right now but tom withered him
joined in with tom and the
of chicken hearted homesickness
to his garments as he could mutiny
to nod and presently
last he got up cautiously on his
flickering reflections flung by the camp fire
picked up and inspected several
semi cylinders of the thin white bark
a sycamore and finally
two which seemed to suit him
he knelt by the fire and painfully
his red keel one
into the hat certain schoolboy
of almost inestimable value among them
lump of chalk an india
ball three fishhooks and
of that kind of
known as a sure nough crystal
he tiptoed his way
felt that he was out of hearing

permit no more wading now
he struck out confidently to
the remaining hundred yards
swam quartering upstream but still was swept
rather faster than he had expected however
reached the shore finally and
jacket pocket found his piece of
following the shore with
place opposite the village
saw the ferryboat lying
the shadow of the trees and
blinking stars he crept
the bank watching with
swam three or four strokes and
at the boat s stern he laid
down under the thwarts
was begun tom felt
the boat s last trip for
night at the end
and swam ashore in the dusk
fifty yards downstream out of danger
possible stragglers he flew along
fence he climbed over approached
ell and looked in at
burning there there sat aunt
sid mary and joe harper
mother grouped together talking
were by the bed and the bed
between them and the door tom
to the door and began to
lift the latch then
pressed gently and the door yielded
what makes the candle blow
said aunt polly tom hurried up
that door s open i believe
of course it is no end of
sid tom disappeared under the bed just
to say only mischeevous
you know he warn t any
meant any harm and he
she began to cry it was just
of mischief but he was
throwed it out myself because
was sour and i
world never never never poor abused boy
some ways sid tom
see it not a word against
harper i don t know how to
him up i don t know how
the lord giveth and the lord hath
away blessed be the name of the

took and filled the
i cracked tom s head with my
the old lady and she broke entirely
could hear mary crying
putting in a kindly word for
began to have a nobler
of himself than ever before
appealed strongly to his
and ends that it was conjectured at
a swim then the small
had been missed next certain
the village should hear
that together and decided that the
and would turn up at the
miles below the village and then
perished they must be
else hunger would have driven
home by nightfall if not sooner it
because the drowning must have occurred in
channel since the boys
escaped to shore this was
night if the bodies continued missing until
all hope would be
harper gave a sobbing good
and turned to go
a bit and mary went
crying with all her heart aunt polly
so touchingly so appealingly and with such
voice that he was weltering in
again long before she was
he had to keep still long
tossing unrestfully and turning over but at
she was still only moaning a little
her sleep now the boy stole out
gradually by the bedside shaded the
light with his hand and stood
pity for her he
out his sycamore scroll and placed
by the candle but something occurred to
of his thought he
straightway made his stealthy exit latching the
the ferry landing found nobody
large there and walked boldly on
tenantless except that there was a
who always turned in and slept
a graven image he untied
the village he started quartering across
bent himself stoutly to his work he
the landing on the other side neatly
he sat down and took a
then started warily down the
was broad daylight before he found
and then he plunged into
come back he won t
he knows that would
tom s too proud for that sort
thing he s up to something
the writing says they are if he
sumptuous breakfast of bacon
they were a vain and boastful company
heroes when the tale was
then tom hid himself away in
shady nook to sleep till noon and
other pirates got ready to fish and
gang turned out to hunt for turtle
they went whooping and prancing out on
were naked and then continued the
to time and greatly increased
fun and now and then
stooped in a group
splashed water in each other
then they all went under
and came up blowing sputtering
and gasping for breath
and cover themselves up
the original performance once more finally it
yield this proudest post to his
without the protection of this
charm he did not venture
by that time the other boys were
apart dropped into the dumps
to where the village lay drowsing
the sun tom found himself writing
in the sand with his
joining them but joe s spirits
gone down almost beyond resurrection he
lay very near the surface huck
melancholy too tom was
had a secret which
up soon he would have to bring
this island before boys we ll
it again they ve hid treasures here
faded out with no
other seductions but they failed too it
discouraging work joe sat poking up
sand with a stick
looking very gloomy finally he said
i want to go home it s
lonesome oh no joe
s here i don t care for
you want to see your
i reckon yes i
and joe snuffled a little well we
his mother won t we huck
huck we ll stay won t we

there now and he
himself who cares said tom nobody wants
me ain t cry babies we ll
won t we huck let

then it was discomforting to see huck
parting word joe began
wade off toward the illinois
sink he glanced at huck huck
his eyes then he said i
to go too tom it was getting
lonesome anyway and now it ll be
go if you want
i mean to stay tom
better go well go long
to pick up his scattered clothes he
get to shore well you
wait a blame long time that
all huck started sorrowfully
and tom stood looking
him with a strong desire tugging at
but they still waded slowly
he made one final struggle
he got to where they were
began unfolding his secret and they
at first they wouldn
have started away he made a plausible
them with him any very great
to hold it in reserve
a last seduction the lads came
with a will chattering all the time
tom s stupendous plan and
learn to smoke now joe caught
had never smoked anything before
on their elbows and
to puff charily and
unpleasant taste and they
it s just as easy if i
a knowed this was all
i said joe it

disjointed the silences widened the
their tongues fast enough to prevent
followed every time both boys were
very pale and miserable now
s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers
and both pumps bailing with might
ve lost my knife i reckon
i ll help you you
over that way and i ll
around by the spring
you needn t come huck we can
an hour then he
comrades they were wide apart in
asleep but something informed him that
huck prepared his pipe after
meal and was going
they ate at dinner had disagreed
boys there was a
oppressiveness in the air that seemed
themselves together and sought the friendly companionship
the fire though the
dead heat of the breathless atmosphere
stifling they sat still intent
the light of the fire
darkness presently there came
quivering glow that vaguely
came a little stronger then another
the night had gone by there
about their feet and it showed
thunder went rolling and tumbling
in the distance a sweep of
lit up the forest and an
crash followed that seemed to rend the
the thick gloom that followed a few
rain drops fell pattering upon the leaves
boys go for the
boys cried out to
other but the roaring wind and
tent cold scared and
with water but to have company in
seemed something to be grateful for they
not talk the old sail flapped
the sail tore loose from its
the boys seized each others hands
shelter of a great oak that stood
clean cut and shadowless distinctness the
the high bluffs on the other side
some giant tree yielded the fight and
storm culminated in one
and the same moment it
with weaker and weaker
and grumblings and peace resumed her sway
boys went back to camp a
by the lightnings and
well for they were but heedless lads
they were eloquent in their distress
they presently discovered that the fire had
so far up under the great
it had been built against where
wrought until with shreds and bark gathered
the under sides of
logs they coaxed the fire
burn again then they
hearted once more they dried their
and after that they sat by the
and expanded and glorified their
a dry spot to sleep on anywhere
as the sun began to steal in
after the meal they felt rusty and
jointed and a little homesick
more tom saw the signs
fell to cheering up
the imposing secret and raised a
interested in a new device
a while and be indians for a
it was not long before they were
and striped from head to
many zebras all of them
the woods to attack an english
by and by they separated
three hostile tribes and
scalped each other by thousands it
toward supper time hungry and happy but
peace there was no
process that ever they had heard of
remained pirates however there was no
way so with such show of cheerfulness
they could muster they called for
pipe and took their whiff as it
into savagery for they had
now smoke a little without
to go and hunt for a lost
promise for lack of effort no they
have been in the
and skinning of the six
no further use for them at
chapter xvii but there was no
put into mourning with
the villagers conducted their concerns
saturday holiday seemed a
in their sports and
gave them up in the
melancholy but she found nothing there
t got anything now
remember him by and she choked back
wandered away with tears rolling down her
then quite a group of boys
girls playmates of tom s and
s came by and stood
tones of how tom did so and
and how joe said this
that small trifle pregnant with awful
speaker pointed out the exact spot where
last in life and many claimed that
tampered with by the
see the departed last and
envied by all the rest one poor
to offer said with tolerably manifest
bid for glory was a failure
distinction too much the group loitered away
recalling memories of the
sunday school hour was finished
to toll instead of ringing in
lay upon nature the
no whispering in the house only
to their seats disturbed the silence
mary and they by the
by muffled sobs and then the
text followed i am the
and the life as the
proceeded the clergyman drew such
of the graces the
there thinking he recognized
had persistently blinded himself to
always before and had as persistently seen
faults and flaws in the
boys the minister related many a
beautiful those episodes were and remembered with
that at the time they occurred
company broke down and joined
weeping mourners in a chorus
anguished sobs the preacher himself giving way
the gallery which nobody noticed
one and then another
of eyes followed the minister
and then almost with one impulse the
rose and stared while
three dead boys came marching
the aisle tom in the
joe next and huck
own funeral sermon aunt polly
ones smothered them with kisses
poured out thanksgivings while
huck stood abashed and uncomfortable
hide from so many unwelcoming eyes he
him and said aunt
it ain t fair
huck and so they shall i m
to see him poor motherless
put your hearts in it and
a triumphant burst and while
was the proudest moment
willing to be made ridiculous again
hear old hundred sung like that once
according to aunt polly s
moods than he had earned before
secret the scheme to return
or six miles below the village they
back lanes and alleys
keep everybody suffering most a week
to let me suffer so
could have come over
give me a hint
way that you warn t
could have done that tom
said aunt polly her face lighting wistfully
don t know twould a spoiled
grieved tone that discomforted the boy it
didn t do it now
that ain t any harm pleaded
it s only tom s giddy way
is always in such
it too tom you ll
back some day when it s
would have cost you so little now
like it i wish now
ain t much a cat does that
dreamt that you was sitting over
by the bed and sid was sitting
the woodbox and mary next
glad your dreams could take
that much trouble about us
i dreamt that joe harper s
so dim now well try to recollect
tom pressed his fingers on his
i ve got it now i

so i did so i did not

tom the sperrit was upon you
was a prophesying that s
mary shut your heads and let tom
said i think he said he
and you shut him up
there somewheres and mrs harper told
joe scaring her with a firecracker
painkiller just as true as
lot of talk bout
the funeral sunday and then
and old miss harper hugged and
it happened just so as
as i m a
you couldn t told
more like if you
what go on tom then i
you prayed for me
i could see you and
every word you said and you went
on a piece of sycamore bark
ain t dead we are only off
pirates and put it on the table
the candle and then you
thought i went and leaned
and kissed you on
you i just forgive you everything
very kind even though it
only a dream sid
just audibly shut up sid
awake here s a big
goodness knows i m unworthy of
blessings and had his
to help them over the rough places
s few enough would smile here
ever enter into his rest
house it was this pretty thin as
a dream as that without any mistakes
it what a hero
was become now he did not
pirate who felt that the public
along but they were food and drink
at his heels as
elephant leading a menagerie into town
and his glittering notoriety and tom
of joe and delivered such eloquent
heroes were not long in
insufferably stuck up they began to tell
adventures to hungry listeners but
an end with imaginations
theirs to furnish material and
summit of glory was
he would live for glory now that
be wanting to make
well let her she
began to talk soon he
that she was tripping gayly back and
and screaming with laughter when she made
capture but he noticed
and that she seemed to
a conscious eye in
that was in him and
instead of winning him
only set him up the
diligent to avoid betraying that he
she was about presently she gave over
and moved irresolutely about sighing once or
and glancing furtively and
toward tom then she observed
now tom was talking more
to amy lawrence than
any one else she
a sharp pang and
mary austin you bad girl why didn
come didn t you see
sit i was in miss peters
where i always go i
you did you why it s
when is it going to be by
furtively at tom but he talked
along to amy lawrence about the terrible
come said grace miller
and me said sally rogers yes
me too said susy harper and joe
and so on with clapping of
had begged for invitations
came to her eyes
else she got away as
what her sex call
good cry then she sat moody
vindictive cast in her eye
tom continued his flirtation
her but there was a
picture book with alfred temple and
absorbed were they and
be conscious of anything in the world
jealousy ran red hot through tom s
he began to hate
for throwing away the chance becky
happily along as they walked for her
what amy was saying and whenever she
expectantly he could only
an awkward assent which was as often
sear his eyeballs with the hateful
there he could not help it
the land of the living
she did see nevertheless and
knew she was winning her fight
and was glad to see him
he had to attend to things
t i ever going
get rid of her at last
and she said artlessly that
would be around when school let
town but that saint louis
that thinks he dresses
right i licked you
through the motions of thrashing an imaginary
pummelling the air and kicking
you you holler nough do you now
let that learn you and
satisfaction tom fled home at noon
more of amy s
happiness and his jealousy
dragged along and no tom came to
followed and then melancholy two or
entirely miserable and wished
hadn t carried it so far
poor alfred seeing that he was
s a jolly one
at this she lost patience
care for them and burst into
and got up and walked away
she would look at pictures all through
nooning and she walked on crying then
the girl had simply made a
to him he wished there was
way to get that boy into
without much risk to
tom s spelling book fell
the afternoon and poured ink upon the
becky glancing in at
window behind him at
moment saw the act and moved on
intending to find tom and tell
thought of tom s treatment
and to hate him forever into the
dreary mood and the first
his aunt said to him showed
a notion to skin
softy expecting i m
about that dream when lo and
from joe that you
a boy that will act like that
could let me go to
harper and make such a fool of
and never say a word this was
merely looked mean and shabby
not think of anything
he said auntie i wish i hadn
t think oh child you

think to come all the way
here from jackson s island
the night to laugh at
troubles and you could think to

she put the jacket away and
by musing a minute twice she put

more she ventured and this time she
lie i won t let
grieve me so she sought
reading tom s piece of
through flowing tears and saying i
aunt polly s manner when she kissed
again he started to school
his mood always determined his manner without
moment s hesitation he ran to
that way again as
won t you the girl stopped
tossed her head and passed
tom was so stunned that he had
even presence of mind enough
say who cares miss smarty
had gone by so
said nothing but he was
a fine rage nevertheless he
and the angry breach was complete it
to becky in her
resentment that she could hardly
tom flogged for the injured spelling book
exposing alfred temple tom s offensive fling
mr dobbins had reached middle
that book under lock and key
about the nature of that book
no two theories were alike and there
no way of getting at the facts
the case now as
was passing by the
that the key was in the
book in her hands the title page
the leaves she came
that moment a shadow fell on the
becky snatched at the
burst out crying with
and vexation tom sawyer
are just as mean as you
be to sneak up on
yourself tom sawyer you know

said be so mean

crying tom stood still
himself what a curious kind of

but what of it

girls faces always tell

out of it tom conned the
see me in just
scholars outside in a few
the master arrived and school
considering all things he did not want

a while after that becky roused up
her lethargy of distress and showed good
in the proceedings she did
expect that tom could get out
spilt the ink on
believe she was glad of
but she found she was
to the worst she had an impulse
to keep still because
not to save his life tom took
sake and because it was custom and
stuck to the denial from principle
air was drowsy with the hum
study by and by mr
straightened himself up yawned then
that watched his movements with intent eyes
dobbins fingered his book absently for a

a flash too but the very
shook for one little instant
the chance was lost the master opened
now he said the
moment the master faced
school every eye sank under his gaze
he spoke who tore this
drop the stillness continued the master
face after face for signs of guilt
denial tom s uneasiness
scanned the ranks of boys considered a
the same sign susan harper did

situation rebecca thatcher tom glanced at her
did you tear no look me
the face her hands
in appeal did you tear this book
and when he stepped forward
the gratitude the adoration that shone upon
seemed pay enough for a hundred
inspired by the splendor
his own act he took without
outcry the most merciless flaying that
mr dobbins had ever administered and
captivity was done and not
to bed that night
and repentance becky had
him all not forgetting
exacting than ever for he wanted the
and his ferule were
only the biggest boys and
ladies of eighteen and
age and there was
sign of feebleness in his muscle
consequence was that the smaller boys
a mischief but he kept
that followed every vengeful
was so sweeping and majestic that
worsted at last they
together and hit upon
plan that promised a dazzling victory they
told him the scheme and
his help he had
own reasons for being delighted for

painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which

fine round of applause when
inspiring curtsy got her meed of
and sat down flushed and
tom sawyer stepped forward with
give me death speech with fine fury
of it a ghastly stage fright
him his legs quaked under him and
he had the house s silence
master frowned and this completed
disaster tom struggled awhile and then retired
on the burning deck

the prize to the author of it
might well be proud of
passing that the number of compositions in

had worn his shackles over
eight hours and fixed
funeral since he was so
concerned about the judge s condition and
hopes ran high so high that
discouraging way of fluctuating at
he was pronounced upon the mend and
resolved that he would never trust a
like that again the funeral was
fine thing the cadets paraded
a style calculated to
the late member with envy tom was
to his surprise that he did
he attempted a diary but nothing happened
shows came to town and
up a band of

the neighborhood of it a circus came
afterward in tents made
boys and girls parties but
were so few and so delightful
anywhere the dreadful secret of the murder
very cancer for permanency and
then came the measles
to the world and its happenings he
last and moved feebly down town a
change had come over everything
and everybody had got religion not
the adults but even
boys and girls tom
about hoping against hope for the
of one blessed sinful face but
a basket of tracts
in desperation he flew for
at last to the
of huckleberry finn and
received with a scriptural quotation his
to bed realizing that he alone
came on a terrific storm with
rain awful claps of thunder
covered his head with
for he had not the shadow
a doubt that all this hubbub was
that this was the
it might have seemed to
to knock the turf from under
insect like himself by and
died without accomplishing its object
not be any more storms
next day the doctors were back tom
entire age when he got
lonely was his estate how companionless
street and found jim
murder in the presence of
victim a bird he found joe
and huck finn up an alley
a stolen melon poor lads they
at last the sleepy
was stirred and vigorously the murder
became the absorbing topic of village
immediately tom could not get away
almost persuaded him that these
as feelers he did not see
cold shiver all the time he took
to a lonely place
have a talk with him
unseal his tongue for a
of distress with another
huck had remained discreet huck have
ever told anybody about that bout what
know what oh course i
a solitary word so help me what
felt more comfortable after
to tell why if
i reckon we re
agreed so they swore
the time it keeps me in a
constant so s i want
same way they go on round me
reckon he s a goner
t you feel sorry for
sometimes most always most
he ain t no account but
he hain t ever done anything

to get money to get drunk
and loafs around considerable
lord we all do that leastways most

when i was out of
me huck and knitted hooks on

done that i do too
lord i hear em say
s the bloodiest looking villain in
em say that if he was to
free they d lynch him and they
they found themselves hanging about the
of the little isolated
that something would happen that
nothing happened there seemed to be no
or fairies interested in
as they had often
before went to the cell grating and
potter some tobacco and matches
their consciences before it
to mend all the
kites and things and show em
the good fishin places was

potter a power and they
day after he hung about the court
drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to
away from time to time but the
out of the court room
invariably heard distressing news the toils
at the end of the second
firm and unshaken and that there
not the slightest question
the window he was in a
state of excitement it was hours before
got to sleep all the village flocked
the packed audience after a long
the jury filed in
took their places shortly afterward potter
sheriff proclaimed the opening of the
delays worked up an atmosphere
hour of the morning that the murder
raised his eyes for a moment but
have no questions to ask him
of the knife near the corpse
for the prosecution said take the
i have no questions
a third witness swore he had
possession take the witness counsel for
audience began to betray annoyance
this attorney mean to
away his client s life
an effort several witnesses deposed concerning
allowed to leave the stand without being
questioned every detail of the
circumstances that occurred in the graveyard
was brought out by credible witnesses
potter s lawyer the perplexity and
of the house expressed itself in murmurs
provoked a reproof from the bench
the oaths of citizens whose simple
fastened this awful crime beyond
possibility of question upon the unhappy
hands and rocked his body softly
were moved and many
the defence rose and said your honor
deed while under the
in every face in the
not even excepting potter s
eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon
as he rose and took his
for he was badly
about the hour of midnight tom glanced
but the words refused
come after a few moments however the
got a little of his strength back
managed to put enough of
part of the house hear
you were in the
s face were you
near horse williams grave yes sir
up just a trifle
as i am to you were you
a barely perceptible start any one with
wait wait a moment never mind
own way don t
in a little while every sound ceased
his own voice every eye fixed itself
no note of time rapt in
ghastly fascinations of the tale
the boy said and
and crash quick as lightning
way through all opposers and was
chapter xxiv tom was a glittering hero
paper magnified him there were
yet if he escaped
potter to its bosom and fondled him
that sort of conduct is to the
s credit therefore it is
well to find fault with
and always with doom in his eye
any temptation could persuade the boy to
abroad after nightfall poor huck
in the same state of wretchedness and
trial and huck was sore afraid that
share in the business might leak
yet notwithstanding injun joe s flight
since tom s harassed conscience had managed
drive him to the
wring a dread tale
with the dismalest and most formidable of
s gratitude made tom glad he
would be he felt sure
never could draw a safe breath
had seen the corpse
omniscient and awe inspiring marvels a detective
made that sort of astounding success which
of that craft usually achieve that is
say he found a clew
after that detective had got
and gone home tom felt just as
as he was before the
days drifted on and each left behind
a slightly lightened weight of apprehension chapter
there comes a time in every rightly
boy s life when he has a
dig for hidden treasure this desire suddenly
upon tom one day he
out to find joe
and opened the matter to
willing to take a hand in
a troublesome superabundance of that sort of
which is not money
ll we dig said
sometimes on islands sometimes in rotten
hides it why robbers of course who
i don t know

there that night about the appointed
waiting it was a lonely
and an hour made solemn
old traditions spirits whispered in the
leaves ghosts lurked in the
nooks the deep baying of a
distance an owl answered with his
and talked little by and by
their hopes commenced to rise their
pace with it the
every time their hearts jumped to
was only a stone or a chunk
last tom said it
can t be wrong we spotted the
to a dot i know it
then there s another
what s that why we only guessed

right we ll tackle the
so but i reckon
started down the hill by this time
the roof caved in the
window then talking in a
circumstances they struck far off
wide berth and took their
homeward through the woods that
the rearward side of
had come for their tools tom
impatient to go to the haunted house
once thought of it huck
i didn t neither

to sink into the
they took their way homeward athwart the
buried from sight in the forests
tree again they had a
shade and then dug
down within six inches of it and
up with a single
of a shovel the thing failed
time however so the boys shouldered their
requirements that belong to the business of
hunting when they reached the
house there was something
weird and grisly about the dead silence
that they were afraid for a
unplastered an ancient fireplace vacant windows a
ready for instant retreat
a little while familiarity modified their fears
they gave the place a
was something like cutting off
but they got to daring
their tools into a
and made the ascent up
promised mystery but the promise
a fraud there was nothing in
in hand they were about to
oh my let s run keep still
toward the door the boys stretched themselves
in the planking and lay waiting
stopped no coming here they are
wish i was out
pleasant in his face the spaniard
whiskers long white hair
sat down on the ground
he i ve thought it all over
dangerous grunted the deaf and dumb
the boys milksop this

this remark and thought how lucky
a day they wished in their hearts
had waited a year the two
got out some food and
where you belong wait there till you
from me i ll take the
that dangerous job after i
spied around a little and think things
well for it then
together this was satisfactory both
presently fell to yawning and injun
said i m dead for sleep
to snore his comrade stirred him
quiet presently the watcher began to nod
head drooped lower and
both men began to snore now the
whispered now s our chance come
urged huck held back at last
rose slowly and softly
started alone but the
were grateful to note that
ceased injun joe sat up stared
head was drooping upon his knees
t you all right though nothing

little swag we ve got left i
away till we start
all right it won t
be a good while before i
the right chance at
in such a very good place we
jingled pleasantly he subtracted
it twenty or thirty
bowie knife the boys forgot
their fears all their miseries
it was beyond all
half a dozen boys
the happiest auspices there would not be
bothersome uncertainty as to where
dig they nudged each other
moment eloquent nudges and easily understood for
hello said he what is it said
comrade half rotten plank

the boys above were as
saw it a minute ago
it over critically shook his
to use it the box was

came creaking up the
situation woke the stricken
of the lads they were about
ground amid the debris of the
stairway he gathered himself up cursing
anybody and they re up there
dark in fifteen minutes and then
them follow us if they want
of us and took us
bet they re running
joe grumbled awhile then
agreed with his friend that what
the house in the deepening twilight
relieved and stared after them through
themselves hating the ill luck that made
take the spade and
pick there but for that injun joe
would have suspected he would
to wait there till his revenge
satisfied and then he would have
the misfortune to find that money
when he should come to town
job and follow him to
two wherever that might be then
oh don t said huck nearly fainting
they entered town they agreed
believe that he might possibly
he might at least mean nobody but
he had his hands on
nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook
hard reality of his
early morning recalling the incidents
a time long gone by
it occurred to him that
great adventure itself must be a dream
was one very strong argument
dollars in one mass
world he never had supposed for
as a hundred dollars was to
to consist of a
adventure grew sensibly sharper
found himself leaning to
impression that the thing
a flatboat listlessly dangling his feet
the water and looking very melancholy

about the neighborhood of the tavern
after nine one watching the alley at
promised to be a fair one
tom went home with the understanding
if a considerable degree of darkness came
huck was to come
same ill luck also
large towel to blindfold it with he
the lantern in huck s sugar
and the watch began an
before midnight the tavern closed
and its lights the only ones thereabouts
reigned the perfect stillness was interrupted only
got his lantern lit it in
towel and the two adventurers
in the gloom toward the
huck stood sentry and tom felt his
was a season of waiting
that weighed upon huck s spirits
the lantern it would frighten him but
would at least tell
that tom was alive
was dead maybe his
to happen that would take away
breath there was not much
take away for he seemed only able
run said he run for
life he needn t have
it once was enough huck was making
repetition was uttered the boys never stopped
they reached the shed
a deserted slaughter house at the
end of the village
i tried two of the keys
of racket that i
t hardly get my breath

stepped onto injun joe

the floor with his
patch on his eye

glad piece of news judge
and they had an exhausting good
mother to appoint the
consented the child s delight was boundless
and straightway the young
to keep awake until
next day but he was disappointed no
ten or eleven o clock
judge thatcher s and everything was
for a start it was not the
few young gentlemen of
three or thereabouts the old
presently the gay throng filed up
main street laden with
baskets sid was sick and had
entertain him the last thing mrs

and don t be any trouble presently

mind and said reluctantly
but shucks your mother
is that you ll be safe
i bet you she d
bait it and tom
persuasions presently carried the
so it was decided
say nothing anybody about the night s
presently it occurred to
could not bear to
up the fun at widow douglas
the night before so why
uncertain treasure and boy
think of the box of
with shoutings and laughter all
to camp fortified with responsible
the good things began
in the shade of spreading
was bundles of candles were
and straightway there was a
scamper up the hill the
opening shaped like a letter a
massive oaken door stood unbarred
was a small chamber chilly
an ice house and walled by
with a cold sweat it was
and mysterious to stand here
quickly wore off and the romping began
the moment a candle was lighted
was a general rush upon the owner
it a struggle and a gallant defence
a glad clamor of laughter and a
chase but all things have an
by and by the procession went
the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing
lofty walls of rock almost
overhead this main avenue
not more than eight or
crooked aisles that ran into each
nowhere it was said that one might
days and nights together through its intricate
of rifts and chasms and never find
that he might go down and
and still down into the earth
it was just the same labyrinth under
man knew the cave that was
a portion of it and
was not customary to venture
the main avenue some three
take each other by
parties were able to
hour without going beyond the known ground
straggling back to the mouth of
cave panting hilarious smeared from
to foot with tallow
daubed with clay and
this sort of close to the
past the wharf he heard no noise
board for the young people were
and then he dropped her out
his mind and put
night was growing cloudy and dark
o clock came and the noise of
and left the small watcher
with the silence and the ghosts eleven
were put out darkness everywhere
time but nothing happened his faith was
remove the treasure why call tom
it would be absurd the men
never be found again no
would stick to their wake and
the darkness for security from
so communing with himself huck
feet allowing them to
the path that led up cardiff
but they never stopped at the quarry
passed on up the summit
plunged into the narrow
and were at once hidden in the
huck closed up and shortened his distance
to see him he trotted
awhile then slackened his pace
he was gaining too fast moved on
heart the hooting of an
winged feet when a man cleared
taken charge of him at
stile leading into widow
them bury it there it won t
voice a very low voice
joe s damn her maybe she s
as it is i can
of the haunted house a
chill went to huck s heart
thought was to fly then
and maybe these men were going to
venture to warn her but he knew
didn t dare they might come
catch him he thought all
and injun joe s next
was because the bush is
don t you yes
it up and maybe never have
chance i tell you again as i
told you before i don t
but her husband was rough on
many times he was rough on me
mainly he was the justice
the peace that jugged me
t all it ain t a
part of it he had me
jail like a nigger with
the town looking on horsewhipped do you
he took advantage of me and died
i would kill him if he
here but not her when you
to get revenge on a woman you
t kill her bosh you go for
looks you slit her nostrils you
to yourself it will be safest
death is that my fault
friend you ll help me in this
alone if you flinch i ll kill
do you understand that and if
have to kill you i
kill her and then
reckon nobody ll ever know
s got to be done
i m all in
shiver do it now and company there
you first thing you know no
ensue a thing still more awful
took another step back with
same elaboration and the same risks
his foot his breath
perfect his gratitude was measureless now
walls of sumach bushes
then stepped quickly but
felt secure and so he
flew down down he sped
he reached the welshman s
of the old man
his two stalwart sons were
everything why who are you
open many doors i judge but let
in lads and let
see what s the trouble
you were huck s first
will tell if you
promise you won t ever say
t act so exclaimed the
man out with it
nobody here ll ever tell lad three
hid behind a great bowlder
fell to listening there was a lagging
cry huck waited for no particulars
fast as his legs could
but it was a sleep
of the exciting episode of the night
call came from a window who
ears and the pleasantest
of tall sons speedily dressed themselves
my boy i hope
will be ready as
we ll have a piping hot
i run i took out when the
for three mile i ve come
you do look as if you
it but there s a bed here
your breakfast no they
sorry enough for that you see we
on them by your description
we crept along on
keep it back but no
twas bound to come and it
my pistol raised and when the sneeze
of the path i sung out fire
boys but they were off in a
those villains and we after them
them they fired a
to guard the river bank
light the sheriff and a gang
will be with them presently i
description of those rascals twould
describe them describe them my
one s the old deaf and dumb
other s a mean looking
the woods back of the
s one day and they
morrow morning the welshman
were leaving the room huck sprang up
was me that blowed on them
please all right if you say
huck but you ought to have
credit of what you did oh no
further than to say that he already
too much about one of those men
would not have the man
him for the whole
the old man promised secrecy once more
m a kind of a hard lot
everybody says so and i
t see nothing agin
and sometimes i can
and sort of trying
strike out a new way of
that was the way
it last night i couldn
sleep and so i
along up street bout midnight a
reckoned they d stole it
by his white whiskers and the patch
his eye and t other one
could you see the rags by
light of the cigars this
well i don t know but
yes that was it i wanted to
i dogged em to the widder s
and stood in the
and heard the ragged one beg
the widder and the spaniard swear he
spile her looks just as i told
dumb man said all that huck
made another terrible mistake
was trying his best
faintest hint of who
get him into trouble in
of all he could do he
several efforts to creep out of his
but the old man s eye was
him and he made blunder after
boy don t be afraid of
world no i d protect you
that slip without intending
know something about that spaniard that
and whispered in his ear tain t
spaniard it s injun joe the welshman
jumped out of his chair
plain enough now when
talked about notching ears
slitting noses i judged that that was
don t take that sort
it the old man said that the
the stile and its
the words had been lightning
a more stunning suddenness from
replied of burglar s tools why what
yes burglar s tools that appears
eye was upon him he would have
details of his anatomy from
to foot and ended by saying that
a laugh was money in a
s pocket because it cut down
then he added poor old chap you
ll come out of it rest and
hope huck was irritated
suspicious excitement for he had dropped the
that the parcel brought from the tavern
the treasure as soon as
s stile he had only
on the whole he felt glad
little episode had happened for now he
mind was at rest and exceedingly
in fact everything seemed to
still in no 2 the men
seize the gold that
without any trouble or any fear of
was a knock at
news had spread the welshman had to
the story of the night to the
preservation was outspoken don t say
another that you re more
me and my boys maybe
course this excited a
and through them be
to the whole town for he refused
you come and wake me we judged
was the use of waking you up
scaring you to death my three
men stood guard at your house
the rest of the
and the story had
be told and retold for
no sabbath school during day school
that not a sign of
two villains had been
s wife dropped alongside of mrs
your becky yes with a startled look
t she stay with
last night why no mrs thatcher
pale and sank into a pew
as aunt polly talking briskly with
harper i ve got
boy that s turned up missing
house last night one
feebly and turned paler than ever
didn t stay with
said mrs harper beginning to look
you seen my tom
morning no m when
you see him last joe
to remember but was not sure he
and young teachers they all said they
not noticed whether tom and becky
homeward trip it was dark no one
of inquiring if any one was missing
young man finally blurted
his fear that they were
wringing her hands the alarm swept from
to lip from group to group from
minutes the bells were
up the cardiff hill
sank into instant insignificance
out and before the horror was
village seemed empty and dead many women
with them too and that was
the town waited for news
when the morning dawned at
all the word that came was
more candles and send
mrs thatcher was almost
sent messages of hope and encouragement
real cheer the old welshman came home
daylight spattered with candle grease smeared
physicians were all at the cave so
mark he don t
it off he never does puts it
on every creature that comes
jaded men began to straggle into
the citizens continued searching all the
remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked
had never been visited before
going to be thoroughly
sent their hollow reverberations to
ear down the sombre aisles
had been found traced upon
hand a grease soiled bit
ribbon mrs thatcher recognized the ribbon and
have of her child and that no
living body before the awful death
a score of men go trooping
a sickening disappointment always followed
accidental discovery just made that the
of the temperance tavern
liquor on his premises
was in a lucid
huck feebly led up to
wild eyed what what
one thing only just one
the widow burst into tears hush hush
then nothing but liquor
powwow if it had been
crying about curious that she should
these thoughts worked their
weariness they gave him he fell asleep
asleep poor wreck tom sawyer find
ah there ain t
left now that s
hope enough or strength
either to go on searching chapter xxxi
to return to tom and becky
share in the picnic they tripped
the murky aisles with the rest of
company visiting the familiar
of the cave wonders
with rather over descriptive names such as
drawing room the cathedral
s palace and so
presently the hide and
engaged in it with zeal until
exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome
and mottoes with which the rocky
still drifting along and talking they
a part of the cave whose walls
not frescoed they smoked their own names
with it had in the slow
niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone
squeezed his small body behind
it curtained a sort of
ambition to be a discoverer
far down into the
they found a spacious cavern
shining stalactites of the
they walked all about it wondering
a bewitching spring whose basin was
with a frostwork of glittering crystals
many fantastic pillars which had
of the ceaseless water drip of
had packed themselves together
creatures and they came flocking down by
candles tom knew their
and the danger of this
bat struck becky s light
with its wing while she was
out of the cavern the bats
new passage that offered and at
why i didn t notice but it
away down below them
far away north or south
t hear them here becky
back yes i reckon we
p raps we better can
it but then the bats if
shuddered at the thought of the dreadful
they started through a corridor
way glancing at each new
to see if there was anything
about the look of
but they were all strange
time tom made an
encouraging sign and he would
cheerily oh it s all right
ain t the one but we
desperate hope of finding
his side in an anguish of fear
tried hard to keep back the tears
they would come at last she said
s go back that way
seem to get worse
said he profound silence silence so deep
even their breathings were conspicuous
and died out in the distance
a ripple of mocking laughter
don t do it again tom
it is horrid but i
know and he shouted
the might was even a chillier
it was but a little while before
could not find his way back
a fool i never thought we might
to come back no i
lost we re lost we never
crying that tom was
might die or lose her reason
around her she buried her face in
all to jeering laughter
begged her to pluck up
again and she said she could
situation this had a better
was no more to blame
she she said so
while hope made a show
reviving not with any reason to
to revive when the spring
it out this economy meant
three or four pieces
claims the children tried to pay attention
of sitting down when time was
direction in any direction was at least
and might bear fruit but to sit
down tom rested with
and they talked of home and
and by a smile dawned and
peace and healing into his own
and his thoughts wandered away
woke up with a breezy little
but it was stricken dead upon
lips and a groan followed it
i don t tom don t look
slept becky you ll
rested now and we ll find the
but i ve seen such
not cheer up becky and
up and wandered along hand in hand
had been in the cave
it was plain that this
gone yet a long time
said they must go
must find a spring
again both were cruelly
she could go a little
fastened his candle to the wall in
of them with some clay thought
for some time then becky broke the
tom i am so hungry tom took
almost smiled it s our wedding
as a barrel for it s all
picnic for us to dream
tom the way grown up people do
wedding cake but it ll be our
dropped the sentence where it was tom
at his moiety there
becky suggested that they
moment then he said
i tell you something becky
s water to drink that
loose to tears and wailings tom did
hunt for us yes they will certainly
would they miss us tom when they
back to the boat i reckon tom
might be dark then would they
tom to his senses and he saw
showed tom that the thing in his
had struck hers also
the thin column of
linger at its top a
could tell all that they knew was
resumed their miseries once more
said it might be sunday now maybe
been missed long ago and
maybe some one would come
tried it but in
darkness the distant echoes sounded so
hours wasted away and
came to torment the
than before the poor morsel of
only whetted desire by and by tom
sh did you hear
the faintest far off shout
tom answered it and leading
corridor in its direction presently he listened
slow however because pitfalls were somewhat common
might be a hundred there was
got down on his
there and wait until the searchers
they listened evidently the distant shoutings
more and they had gone altogether the
was hoarse but it was
sounds came again the children groped
the weary time dragged
these than bear the weight of
heavy time in idleness he took a
and becky started tom in the
made an effort to stretch yet
moment not twenty yards away a
hand holding a candle appeared from
a rock tom lifted
a glorious shout and instantly
it belonged to injun joe s
was paralyzed he could not move
not recognized his voice and
over and killed him for testifying in
disguised the voice without doubt that
strength enough to get back to the
he would stay there
nothing should tempt him to
the risk of meeting
joe again he was
to keep from becky what it
the children awoke tortured with a raging
risk injun joe and all other terrors
had sunk into a dreary
she said she would
would not be long
told tom to go with the
line and explore if he chose but
implored him to come
every little while and speak
tom kissed her with a choking
in his throat and made a
the kite line in
hand and went groping
chapter xxxii tuesday afternoon
offered up for them and many and
the cave the majority of the
had given up the quest and
it was plain the children
never be found mrs thatcher was very
and a great part
wearily down again with a
a settled melancholy and her gray
turn out turn out they re
they re found tin pans and
massed itself and moved
citizens thronged around it joined its homeward
and swept magnificently up the main street
went to bed again it was the
saved ones and kissed them squeezed mrs
and drifted out raining tears all
s nearly so it
be complete however as soon as
messenger dispatched with the great news to
a sofa with an
putting in many striking additions
adorn it withal and
becky and went on an exploring
as far as his
a third to the fullest stretch
about to turn back when he glimpsed
far off speck that looked
daylight dropped the line and groped toward
happened to be night he
not have seen that speck of daylight
he told how he went back
such stuff for she was
and how she almost
for joy when she had groped to
hole and then helped
some men came along
them and told them their situation
are five miles down the river
took them aboard rowed to a
home before day dawn judge thatcher and
handful of searchers with him were tracked
had strung behind them
off at once as tom and
wednesday and thursday and
worn all the time tom got
and nearly as whole as ever saturday
until sunday and then she looked as
learned of huck s sickness and went
be admitted to the bedroom
warned to keep still about his
man s body had eventually been
landing he had been drowned while
to escape perhaps about a fortnight after
started off to visit huck who had
plenty strong enough now to
some that would interest him
thought judge thatcher s house was on
asked him ironically if
wouldn t like to go
that cave any more
boy here run somebody fetch a glass
water the water was
oh judge injun joe s in
in the skiff that bore judge thatcher
the cave door was
a sorrowful sight presented itself in
dim twilight of the place
ground dead with his face close to
longing eyes had been fixed to the
which revealed to him in a
before how vast a
of dread had been lying upon him
the day he lifted his voice
this bloody minded outcast injun joe
in two the great
beam of the door had
labor useless labor too it
outside it and upon that stubborn material
knife had wrought no effect the only
done was to the knife
stony obstruction there the labor would have
useless still for if
beam had been wholly cut away injun
so he had only hacked that place
ordinarily one could find half a
bits of candle stuck around
the crevices of this vestibule
bats and these also he had eaten
only their claws the poor unfortunate
starved to death in one place near
hand a stalagmite had been slowly
up from the ground for
builded by the water
and upon the stump had placed a
that fell once in every three
once in four and twenty hours that
was falling when the pyramids were
of rome were laid when christ
it will still be falling when all
of history and the twilight of tradition
been swallowed up in the thick night
oblivion has everything a purpose and
mission did this drop fall
need and has it
important object to accomplish ten thousand years
many and many a
to this day the tourist
first in the list of the cavern
it injun joe was
in boats and wagons
sorts of provisions and
that they had had
of one thing the petition
in deep mourning and
to scribble their names to
pardon petition and drip a tear on
water works the morning after the funeral

an important talk huck had learned all

and things but you
ain t anybody as polite
loving you and after they ve
leave if you drove them
n to be a pirate yes
s better in some ways because it
close to home and circuses
all that by this time everything was
and the boys entered the hole
to the farther end of
few steps brought them
the spring and tom
how he and becky had watched
flame struggle and expire
boys began to quiet down
they reached the jumping off place
candles revealed the fact that it
a steep clay hill
the corner as you
cross now where s
number two under the cross hey
stared at the mystic sign awhile
injun joe s ghost is
ain t huck no it ain t
would ha nt the
wouldn t it would hang round
of ghosts and so do you tom
but presently an idea occurred
joe s ghost ain
a going to come around
of that but that s so
is i reckon we ll climb
the clay hill as
descended huck followed four avenues
the great rock stood in
boys examined three of them
no result they found a
recess in the one
bacon rind and the well gnawed
box the lads searched and
it can t be
once more and then
down discouraged huck could
said lookyhere huck there s footprints and
candle grease on the clay
with animation tom s real
struck wood hey huck you
some boards were soon
into this and held his
he could but said he could
see to the end of
and passed under the
a short curve by and
it was the treasure box sure enough
guns in leather cases two or
water drip got it at last
huck ploughing among the
we re rich tom huck i always
s just too good
it sure say let
not fool around here let s snake

tom could lift it after
i thought so he said they
day at the ha

bags along the money was soon in
up to the cross rock
said huck no huck leave
to have when we go to
we ll keep them there all
there too it s
been in here a long time it
we get to the skiff they presently
into the clump of sumach
looked warily out found the coast
and were soon lunching and smoking in
horizon they pushed out
through the long twilight
cheerily with huck and landed shortly
the loft of the
s woodshed and i
hunt up a place out in
will be safe just you lay
here and watch the
returned with the wagon
the two small sacks
on top of them and
house they stopped to rest just as
out and said hallo who s that
me boys you are keeping everybody waiting
hurry up trot ahead i ll
the wagon for you
as it might be got
said tom i judged so the boys
sell to the foundry than they would
nature hurry along hurry along the boys
to know what the hurry was about
apprehension for he was long used to
falsely accused mr jones
haven t been doing nothing the welshman
you and the widow good friends yes
she s ben good
what do you want to be
huck s slow mind
with tom into mrs douglas drawing room
consequence in the village was
rogerses aunt polly sid
the minister the editor and a
with clay and candle grease
and shook her head at tom nobody
half as much as the
boys did however mr
i gave him up but
stumbled on him and huck right at
with me boys she took them
a bedchamber and said
new suits of clothes
socks everything complete they re huck
other but they ll fit both of
when you are slicked

widow s parties that she
always having this time it s for
welshman and his sons on account of
scrape they helped her out
the people here to night
i overheard him tell
a secret but i
it s not much of a secret
mr jones was bound huck should
his grand secret without huck you
secret about what sid
huck tracking the robbers to
to make a grand time over his
but i bet you it will drop
mind who it was somebody
that s enough sid there s
mean enough to do that
d a sneaked down
t bear to see
you ll catch it some minutes later
widow s guests were at the supper
time mr jones made his little speech
which he thanked the widow for
another person whose modesty
share in the adventure
largely counterfeit and not as clamorous
been under happier circumstances however the widow
a pretty fair show of astonishment and
much gratitude upon huck that
almost forgot the nearly
discomfort of his new clothes in
entirely intolerable discomfort of being set up
gaze and everybody s laudations the
said huck don t need
huck s rich nothing
good manners of the company kept back
at this pleasant joke
needn t smile i reckon i
show you you just wait
a perplexed interest and
he well there ain t ever
tom entered struggling with the weight
did not finish her sentence tom poured
half of it s
the spectacle took the
breath away all gazed nobody
for a moment then there
a unanimous call for an explanation
from any one to
to anything now this one makes it
money was counted the
amounted to a little over twelve thousand
it was more than
before though several persons were there
satisfied that tom s and huck s
of them wherever tom
huck appeared they were courted
to remember that their remarks
treasured and repeated everything they
of doing and saying commonplace
up and discovered to bear marks
widow douglas put huck
money out at six
cent and judge thatcher did the
day in the year and
what the minister got no
was what he was promised he
and wash him too
that matter judge thatcher had conceived a
opinion of tom he
pleaded grace for the
shoulders to his own the
was a noble a
a magnanimous lie a
that was worthy to hold up
head and march down through history breast
her father had never looked
that she went straight off and told
about it judge thatcher hoped to see
meant to look to it that
should be admitted to the
military academy and afterward trained in the
law school in the country in order
career or both huck finn s
dragged him into it
sheets that had not one
spot or stain which he
to eat with a knife
learn his book he had
become insipid in his mouth whithersoever
shut him in and bound him hand

hunted for him everywhere
great distress the public were
the abandoned slaughter house and
breakfasted upon some stolen

consciousness and an intense
as to all that went on around
from the dressing room stretching and pluming
waiting escorts sally carrol hopper

and romantic yearning a picture of
beaux and then driving
afternoon of splashing and singing
into the thoughtless reverie that
puffs tucked in the fronts of low
scents to float out
light that fell through the door

the counter and two boys lazily
a pair of dice at one
when he saw clark coming in
the same moment clark looked up hi

could scarcely last better go easy he
whispered it was eight on the dice
she called her number little ada
decatur rolled over the
nancy was flushed and half hysterical
nancy tried for a
the only sound now nancy had the

joe followed singing a drowsy song
east along the golf course
faint rug of gray
the engine warmed up
night there was a
and then a soft happy voice added
off to a burst of singing a
on a farm across the way took
a solitary mournful crow and behind
cheeks or to know that it

an ancient prayer book

gray when jelly bean entered the
became a rich and vivid blue
he turned on his
going to the window
the awakening of his emotions
a dull ache at
utter grayness of his life a
as definite and tangible
room and with his perception
been the romance of his existence the
shop and street stand
flight of time that
bean was suddenly vanished the
triviality with a flood
that even nancy s kiss
the dawn would have
part the jelly bean had used for
had been her moral laundry the stains
crossed to his bed and threw
down on it gripping the edges
he said this something gave way within
like a lump melting
his throat the air
and became radiant with dawn and
was hailed by the
the jelly bean shook his head never

word halting the camel had a

of growing quite dull
dance this evening was
circus ball up at the
were two middle aged sycophants
moment that mrs tate was grasped
by the skirt and her youngest daughter
aged eleven hurled herself with an oof
her mother s arms why emily
look like a dog
do you mean emily the sycophants
laughed you saw a mean old shadow
thing mamma big i was
more people and this dog or
must have seen something
said the sycophants agreed that the
step away from the door as the
form rounded the corner and
saw what was apparently
huge beast looking down at them hungrily
invader in fact the young people immediately
rather disdainfully and sauntered over with their
in their pockets feeling
uttered little shouts of
it s a camel well if
there uncertainly swaying slightly from
floor and was standing chatting
a young man in the hall
they heard the noise of shouting up
and almost immediately a succession
bumping sounds followed by the precipitous appearance
to be going somewhere
here grab it butterfield grab it
young man enveloped the rear of
and stood resignedly in a state of
down stairs and mr tate suspecting everything
an ingenious burglar to an escaped
gave crisp directions to
into the library and mr tate
locking the door took a
from a table drawer and
thing s head off then he
amazement got the wrong party

suggestion when a butler had appeared
bottles was handed back thereafter the
a benign hour at

that they d better be starting he

they traversed on foot the
block between the tate house and the
club the circus ball was in full
a great tent fly had
vacated and over the floor
a shouting laughing medley of
and color downs bearded ladies acrobats bareback
their party of success
from their house and was
on the wall above the bar was
there the entrance of the camel created
was immediately surrounded by a
hungry melancholy gaze and then
a booth talking to a comic policeman
an egyptian snake charmer
tawny hair was braided
drawn through brass rings the effect
face was stained to a warm
glow and on her
venomous green her feet were in
a glittering cobra altogether a charming costume
that caused the more nervous among
older women to shrink
eyes of the camel saw
her face radiant animated
glowing with excitement and her arms
fascinated and his fascination exercised a
to issue the preparatory command necessary
locomotion but at this
sardonically decided to reward him
kismet turned the tawny eyes of the
lean toward the man beside
and say who s that
but a little man

jovially that she was

unhappy interest his tie of
glory was faded and thumb creased it
no longer to hide the jagged
of his collar he thought quite

paused i d better start at the
a hesitant note in dean
voice this trip east had been planned
a little go on he
month and then came down to new
i m coming to
turn to in a matter like
just tell you frankly
you phil dean stiffened a
he was not even sure he wanted
was something in this present misery
repelled him and hardened him even
it excited his curiosity go
it s a girl hm dean resolved
nothing was going to spoil
then he d have
see less of gordon her name
lived here in new york
did was to welcome the newly arrived
to see everybody and
them glad to see me you ought
now you know and phil

in the world i most certainly
not my family keep darn close
on what i spend
no prig lord knows

his head impatiently there s a

nights said gordon rather defiantly i don
i depress myself but my
a streak and you know

on some other woman
to see you this way

back this was encouraging gordon
it was probably wisest to be
start to sell drawings
of doubt over gordon was it possible
he wouldn t get

of my rope i d come to

bit his lip feeling
in his voice after all he was
said dean angrily you put

tell you it s no
of three hundred dollars my income isn
began to dress choosing his clothes carefully
mouth was dry and
in his blood resolving itself into innumerable
piece of tobacco from
teeth with solemnity next he
waste basket and settled
case in his vest pocket had
about that money later
m sick of the
good time let s go over
the yale club he continued moodily and
nothing else to do i d have
heaven s sake drop the subject for
while no point in glooming
my whole trip here here s
dollar bill from his wallet and tossed
an added spot of color
own glance quickly for
and forty fourth street swarmed with
noon crowd the wealthy happy sun glittered
upon the laces and silks
expensive dresses upon the bad paintings and
fine period furniture in the elaborate
rooms of interior decorators
girls in pairs and groups
the jewelry stores and
their wedding rings and their
sundaes they had eaten
were men in uniform sailors from the
fleet anchored in the hudson soldiers
divisional insignia from massachusetts to
great city thoroughly fed up with soldiers
they were nicely massed
pretty formations and uncomfortable under
weight of a pack and rifle through
gaudiest the latter reminded
how often he had been one
and dissipated to dean the struggle
significant young cheerful to gordon it was
meaningless endless in the yale club
met a group of
conversation tiresome and interminable
the afternoon began they were all
since the war edith bradin s coming

her brother occasionally he s sort of
socialistic nut runs a paper or
like his gay sister eh continued his
informant well she s coming
night with a junior named
times he glanced nervously
his wrist watch at four to
relief dean rose and announced
over in rivers he
did he think narrow ties were coming
that rivers couldn t get
never was a collar
a panic he wanted the money immediately
he was now inspired
attending the gamma psi dance
whom he hadn t met since one
debonnaire immersed in her own inconsequential chatter
had been a dozen sketches
her playing golf swimming
could draw her pert arresting profile
he was to be beaten after all
difficulty he restrained himself from
the biltmore a biltmore
for the dance of a famous
of a famous university but
a last appeal was
led him aside gordy
thing over carefully and
ve decided that i
teeth projected i m
sorry gordon continued dean but that s
wallet and deliberately counted out seventy five
here s seventy five that
eighty all together that s all
actual cash i have with me besides

an afterthought oh boy by the time
hatless young ladies each one attended by

them to be the least elaborate

she was still quite angry when she
the intervening parlor of politeness that opened
the hall angry not so much at
actual happening which was after all the
it had occurred on this
she had succinctly and deftly snubbed
it had happened when their taxi
half a block he
his right side and attempted to
in itself had been a mistake it
her it avoided that awkward
was extremely repugnant yet as peter
his unfortunate attempt the point
enough he had begun to murmur
was nothing but a college boy
reminding her with the accelerating
adolescent mooniness edith bradin was falling in
dress in front of her at the
of yale men who
like dignified black moths
the head of the
from the room she had left drifted
drifting out acquired the tang of
smoke in the hall and
settled sensuously down the
gamma psi dance was to be held
appearance her bare arms
shoulders were powdered to a
white she knew they looked very soft
backs that were to silhouette
marvel of mobile curves her lips were
made of deep carmine the irises of
eyes were delicate breakable blue
beauty flowing in an even
high and low laughter and
the stairs she would talk the language
line made up of
near her say you don
she smiled her anger melted
simply and then came
liked the sound of this
thought it again then inevitable
came her new born riot of
about gordon the twist of her
girl there was a streak in her
idealism that had turned her brother socialist
pacifist henry bradin had
cures for incurable evils
the columns of a
was a quality of weakness in
tired she wanted to get married out
a pile of letters half
dozen pictures and as many memories
this weariness she had decided that next
she saw gordon their relations
was this evening this was her
all evenings were her evenings then
an air of strained
horned rimmed glasses and
air of attractive whimsicality
not succeeded in kissing her
me not at all she stepped forward
took his arm i m sorry
sorry s all right he mumbled
same consciously gentle key we ll both
it for this he hated
a few minutes later they drifted out
informed the crowded ballroom that if
saxophone and me are
he began reprovingly you don t
me i can t just think
your name she said lightly
fair hair cut in edith murmured
conventional thanks loads cut in later to
name a mystery she remembered even that
and found as they started that
you biltmore call me up some
a dark man cut in with intense
you don t remember me do you
i knew there were two syllables
you re the boy that
the ukulele so well up at
but you used to come
here to night i
edith started yet she had
quite sure he would be
gordon very white and listless
against the side of
wan that the hand he raised to
lips with a cigarette
the short man was saying hello gordon
edith over her partner s shoulder her
was pounding wildly his large dark
were fixed on her
before long so then
she was dancing suddenly with gordon one
spread her hand holding the little
handkerchief was crushed in his why
slipped again was tossed forward by
recovery until her face touched the black
of his dinner coat she loved
she knew she loved him then
a minute there was
while a strange feeling of uneasiness
her heart wrenched and turned over
she realized what it
he was pitiful and wretched a little
and miserably tired oh she cried involuntarily
we ll sit down
sides of the room so
halted seized gordon s limp hand
eyes trembling with tears she found
he began staring at her unsteadily
of this on her was
all the way down
chauffeurs and her feelings had varied from
to disgust but here for the first
unutterable horror gordon she said accusingly
almost crying you look like the devil
but i m all
to pieces i m
sagging he seemed scarcely to
her can t you
tell me about it gordon you know
m always interested in
had intended to say something stronger but
at the end that she
t bring it out gordon shook
t tell a good woman the story
she said defiantly i think it
drinking gordon thanks he inclined his head
miserable do you think
what you doing trying to reform me
can t you tell me
it i m in an
is to pretend not to know me
gordon i m sorry i cut
you you re pure woman and all
some one else to dance with you
rose clumsily to his feet but she
up and pulled him down beside
admit it i m a
crazy something s wrong with me
was always queer little bit different
it s all wrong things
s about to come
when a few more
turned his eyes full
shrank away from him what
the matter just me he repeated i
going loony this whole place
like a dream to
saw he had changed utterly
careless a great lethargy and discouragement
come over him revulsion seized her followed
voice seemed to come out of
artist now i know i m nothing
t draw edith don
draw i can t do anything
m poor as a
time waiting for her first possible cue
turning to her with what
to me to know there s
reached out and patted her
it s mighty fine of
to see an old friend but
while they looked at
other and the momentary eagerness in
at him her face quite expressionless
we dance she suggested coolly love is
she was thinking but perhaps the pieces
saved the things that hovered on lips
treasured up for the next lover v
himmel escort to the
sure of his ground
searched in vain for any reason why
should have taken this attitude in the
any girl ever led
room adjoining it which he had located
second highball boredom disgust
events sank into a vague background
themselves things lay quietly on their
the troubles of the
curt wish of dismissal marched off and
brilliant permeating symbolism edith became a flighty
about him he himself
type of the continent
the warm glow and he lapsed into
back in pleasant water it was
a pair of eyes were watching
intently hm murmured peter calmly
the door remained stationary and then
intermittent whispers one guy what s he
the words filtered into his consciousness
this he thought is most remarkable he
he arose and waited around
do he said private rose set one
him searchingly suspecting possible sarcasm o right
chair sit down i got a
said rose i got a
door by all means let
have him in peter
over opened the door and welcomed in
key very suspicious and
took their seats around the punch bowl
gave them each a
and offered them a cigarette from his
they accepted both with
diffidence now continued peter
scrubbing brushes and when the
day except sunday he paused
peter will you tell me why when
looked at rose they laughed they laughed
they found it was
with this man they were laughing
either raving drunk or
crazy you are yale men i presume
laughed again na ah so
that lowly section of the university known
the sheffield scientific school na ah

peter rising and filling their glasses
interestin had a date with
scrublady eh they both denied
indignantly it s all right peter reassured
his glass i got a girl
here that s spoiled spoildest
me no reason whatsoever led
kiss you and then plunk threw
say tha s hard
a sort of fight for a while
it was too far
i was in the
this was with a bolshevik
defiant patriotism sure said
new york for his feat of
on his head and shimmying with his
the glow of a noble
mind floated vaguely on the bosom
her music her partners
with the unreality of
under the colorful shifting
as if days had passed since the
fragmentary subjects with many men she had
kissed once and made love to
times earlier in the
different under graduates had danced with her
had singled her out
were alternating her charms with
cut in on her in regular inevitable
gordon he had been sitting
long time on the stairway with his
feet danced and her voice talked
in hazy sentimental banter
edith was not nearly so tired as
peter himmel cut in on her sublimely
up at him why peter
peach you are don t you think
was looking at her with owlish
shame were both gone she was a
kiss her second for
in and looking up at edith
she asked no the red
night this extreme diffidence was
immediately dissolve into a
d be darn glad
sweet she glanced at her wrist
it was half past one
her brother had told her at
that he worked in the office
evening edith turned suddenly to her
i mean what cross
street and just around the corner and
occurred to her immediately
she might slip over for
moment and surprise him float in
her new crimson opera cloak
cheer him up it
exactly the sort of
edith revelled in doing
out and gripped at
imagination after an instant s hesitation
had decided my hair
just about to tumble
down she said pleasantly to
and fix it not at all you
her crimson opera cloak she flitted down
side stairs her cheeks glowing with excitement
chinned waiter and an over rouged
door stepped into the
may night vii the over rouged young
glance then turned again
up and tell him

and despair were mingled
only shadowy tombs of the late
s splendor glancing down
glimmering parallels of light
the station and streaked along into the
dark but at forty
a night in her childhood when she
walked around the block in her
a mystery big back
on forty fourth in the upper window
which she thankfully detected a
of light it was bright enough
the sign beside the window the
york trumpet she stepped
second saw the stairs in the
with file copies of newspapers there were
two occupants they were
room each wearing a green eye
light for a moment she stood uncertainly
turned around simultaneously and
recognized her brother why edith he rose
and approached her in surprise
his eye shade he was
away eyes that seemed
fixed just over the
and kissed her cheek what
it he repeated in some alarm
delmonico s henry she said
and i couldn t resist tearing over
see you i m glad you
to be out alone
the other end of the room
little twinkling eyes and having removed his
middle western farmer on a sunday
smiling my name s bartholomew miss
politely well he continued not exactly
quarters we have here are they

s pretty good edith swung herself
a vacant desk and sat dangling her
at the biltmore with the hoyts until
especially busy he objected and i hate
for you at twelve
without some parting pleasantry well he began
they both turned to him well we
evening the two men exchanged glances you
have come earlier continued bartholomew somewhat encouraged
really a serenade said
the street and began to
crowd said henry abstractedly all
he seemed to consider
a sufficient cue for
soldiers all set against
shade and yawned the
race has come a long
he said casually but most of
are throw backs the soldiers don
they seem to have to make demonstrations
the disturbance here pretty serious not a
clock and began to bellow
to be i am i suppose you
while you re young why do i
like the priggish and earnest youth
she paused but somehow i began
your purposes it seems sort of
incongruous doesn t it me being at

stopped and her voice dropped a
i wish you d you d come

that he had left his desk

to the pane soldiers by god he
emphatically i had an idea they d

said edith peering from the window they
s more of them coming
there s a whole
by the yellow glow and blue shadows
crowded with men they were
as a long silhouette against the
lights immediately the shouting
a steady yell and a
fusillade of small missiles corners
they re coming up cried bartholomew
turned anxiously to henry they re
in a dream edith was
like a cloud of
of many feet on
stairs that henry had seized her arm
rear of the office then
to be in front hello
girl damn you she noticed that two
drunken soldiers had been forced
henry stepped forward and raised his hand
i ask you in
a table suddenly held up a newspaper

a sudden the room
that the tall soldier with
dark one had disappeared she
slightly backward stood close

fat man swinging a chair over his
the open window with a frightened
that there were other figures in the
sweeping here and there in
increased and then stopped suddenly the lights
here now the room
to empty like a wash bowl
policeman fast grappled in the
released his hold on his soldier antagonist
started him with a
toward the door the deep voice
edith perceived now that it came
a bull necked police captain standing near
her fists on the back
the man in front
a very pale figure sitting on the
close to a desk henry

somewhere between forty fourth street
soldiers had met some women and
lights of childs to minister to his

here and there a
hilarious young man wandered fraternally and
between the tables shaking hands
and pausing occasionally for a facetious chat
bumped him out of the
least crowded table the whole scene
a colorful circus of beauty and riotous

to the crowd were not

would answer by inclining
scrutinized them dumbly for some minutes until
then he shifted his gaze
protracted circuit of the tables to

with awe key was dead he
nut he was a darn good guy
promenaders approached and started down

i know answered john
from his eyes ten minutes later
to him his father had tried time
changed to something with a little
a hearty handshake pricked out in
so john took his
destination and as he turned
seemed full of a warm and passionate
hour from boston in a
pierce motor car the
no one except john
unger had ever arrived there save
a rolls pierce and probably
exclusive boys preparatory school in the world
passed pleasantly the fathers of all
spent his summer visiting
fashionable resorts while he was very
fathers struck him as
would muster a faint smile and answer
certainly is his response would
this joke at best varying
the middle of his second year at
a quiet handsome boy named percy washington
form the new comer was pleasant
the other boys the only
entirely uncommunicative concerning his
went without saying but beyond a
to spend the summer
his home in the west he accepted
hesitation it was only
and made an abrupt remark my father
said is by far the richest man
hollow and was on the
scarcely be questioned by far the
there was one man in america
an income of over five million
years and four men
mouth was a half moon of scorn
penny capitalists financial small fry petty
and money lenders my father could
d done it but
tax because he doesn t pay
on his real income he must
glad i like very
is the better i
him there was a
of passionate frankness upon
dark face i visited the schnlitzer murphys
as hen s eggs and sapphires
love jewels agreed percy enthusiastically of
i wouldn t want any one
walnuts that s nothing percy had

a poisoned sky an immense

rock upon which a mysterious
force had begotten them

a congregation who lifted up

human or inhuman deposit at
at two minutes after seven percy
an hour when the twilight had coagulated
the gloom in response
his cry it turned upon them a
automobile larger and more magnificent
its body was of gleaming metal richer
nickel and lighter than silver and
with iridescent geometric figures
guess whether they were
or jewel two negroes
in glittering livery such as one sees
pictures of royal processions
london were standing at
buggy they were greeted in some language
but which seemed to
an extreme form of the
percy to his friend
on the train or those god
the upholstery consisted of
in which the boys luxuriated
the two mountains we ll

said percy looking at the
prepared to be astonished indeed
of its creed had john
otherwise than radiantly humble
them his parents would have turned away
horror at the blasphemy
between the two mountains and almost
the way became much rougher if
d see that we re in a
the hillsides with an immense beam
hour in fact it d take a
to navigate it unless you knew
way you notice we re
risen in the distance
two young men were
in the same dimly
dialect then the negroes set to work
car being lifted slowly from
then higher until he could
a wavy moonlit valley stretched out before
in sharp contrast to the quagmire
suddenly there was no rock beside
moment they were going down again
finally with a soft
the worst is over
we in canada we are
of the montana rockies
they tried to do it three
states tinkered with that held
time was harder my father fixed it
magnetic field ever artificially
that would allow for this territory not
on its banks so
they d see it and think it
father s afraid of he concluded
guns and we ve arranged it
we mind that you know
and i but it
the chance that some time we
shreds and tatters of chinchilla courtesy
in the green moon s heaven
eastern stuffs paraded for the
of some tartar khan it seemed
the air showering down tracts and patent
circulars with their messages
clouds and stare and stare at
in this place whither he was
immured far from patent medicines and from
did a quick puff
a splitting shell bring them
and sisters john shook
what desperate transaction lay hidden here
a moral expedient of a bizarre croesus
day the tapestry brick of the road
the great tyres as they
a still moonlit lake they passed into
for a moment a pine
we re home full in
in grace in perfect symmetry
a forest of pine the
the sloping parapets the
wonder of a thousand yellow windows
golden light the shattered softness
the intersecting planes of star
and blue shade all trembled
john s spirit like a chord
music on one of the towers
as john gazed up in warm enchantment
doors swung silently open and amber light
out upon the darkness silhouetting
figure of an exquisite lady with
high piled hair who held out
this is my friend john unger
first night as a daze of many
of quick sensory impressions of music soft
beauty of things lights and
golden stem there was a girl with

it was lined with
size and shape until lit
that could be compared
with itself beyond human
or dream through a
the floor under their
subtle and intricate mosaic surely from some
on the adriatic sea sometimes
layers of thick crystal he would
blue or green water
diamond between which was curiously worked
corridors his chair feathered
and overpower him as he drank his
a ghostly laugh then without
without resistance he seemed to float
was pink as a dream he
asleep when he awoke he knew
several hours had passed
was in a great quiet room
ebony walls and a dull
that was too faint too subtle
to be comfortable again after
bed or a cloud sighed
percy percy before you
as the ritz carlton hotel percy
me it s that mountain
feet of sod and gravel on
it s solid diamond one diamond
as he awoke he perceived
that the room had at the same
become dense with sunlight
ebony panels of one
uniform stood beside his
the wild places good morning sir
just unbutton your pyjamas there thank you
delighted he expected to be lifted like
the wall its drapery
looked about him the runway or
on which he had arrived had
gently back into place

about him lining the walls of

d like hot rosewater and
this morning sir and
standing beside him yes agreed
ordering this bath according to
from overhead but really
john discovered after a

which enveloped him softly with its
rosy bubbles here and
in a moment if
but firmly he was enjoying his
like a waterfall cool
green as the room
accompanying a frothy piccolo
play more fragile than the lace of
that covered and charmed him after
cold salt water bracer and
and into a fleecy robe and
and spice later he sat
and his hair was trimmed
gygsum mr unger sir i am to

selected two dozen of the most
blacks who of course
and things were going very poorly indeed
his way when riding the room and
bath itself was a blue aquarium
sat he could see fish
curiosity past his outstretched toes which were
crystal from overhead sunlight came down
cold salt water to finish the negro
meagre standards of living would have been
and not a little wicked the
pressed a button and
warm rain began to fall
john discovered after a moment from
the corners of the

paddle wheels fixed to
sides had churned the mixture into
about him shall i
reel comedy in this machine to day
no thanks answered john politely but firmly
desire any distraction but distraction came

golden haze which hovered idly above

of pine forest that
blue green even as john
out from one clump
gaiety into the black ribbed half
way among the trees or to
marble steps disturbing faintly the
white and blue brick that seemed
lead in no particular
felicity as well as its
imagined future flowers and
and prophecies of that
unattainable young dream john rounded a
corner where the massed rosebushes filled the
of moss under some
he had never lain upon moss and
wanted to see whether it was
a white little gown that came just
with blue slices of sapphire
bare feet scattered the
than sixteen hallo she

a great deal you met my
eye continued and when i
sick i m sweet
when i m well you

a hoarse voice a glass
was enough to make him utterly indifferent

to make upon it for she did
discuss it further i m
east to school this
she said d you think

startled continued kismine when she
that you were from

at dancing school in hades
kismine sweetly i have to be with

asked me to kiss you
i thought boys always did
of them do he answered but
6 john stood facing mr
washington in the full
the elder man was about
and a robust figure in the mornings
side of the mountain in my youth
of life by a period of
in luxury for instance i equipped every
that they used the bathtubs to keep
in mr schnlitzer murphy told
that once he the opinions
in their bathtubs they
sulphuric acid shampoo i discontinued
races except as a beverage john laughed
the ones my father
two hundred and fifty now you
a few of them up to
of the house servants this is
many men in the cage
asked percy suddenly braddock washington stumbled
let forth an involuntary curse one less
there should be he ejaculated darkly and
he fell somewhere in
there s always the
his story wouldn t be believed nevertheless
agent they d each killed a man
to that description but of course
had come to a large
the air up there
if you ll push down that
for me will you it was
dark to see clearly into the
mr washington put out his cane
touched a button in the grass
some adventurous mariners who had the misfortune
them there had appeared a large hollow
glass and on its slightly concave
fed healthy lot braddock washington drew
garden chair to the edge of the
of execration in which
dispirited to cry out
up into the sunny air
braddock washington heard it with unruffled
away he spoke again have you thought
a way out of your
remark floated up we decided
stay here for love bring
i d never seen you your
consider it but so long as you
know about the new one you ve
far this isn t as hard
with all your howling
d never have taken up
the others and held
his hand to call his
s attention to what he was
to say let me
you a few questions he cried
pretend to be a
the two dozen fell
before you re not a
and you re not fair minded
able to put yourself in
place for long enough to think

involved you ve been soldiers
know that try another well then how
painlessly executed if you wish i ve
to have your wives sweethearts children and
i ll enlarge your place down
of your lives if
was some method of producing permanent amnesia
released immediately somewhere outside of my
but that s as far
my ideas go how about
man to teach my
italian last week he got away
wild yell of jubilation went
and a pandemonium of joy ensued the
clog danced and cheered and
the bowl as far
started a song in
they all joined oh
over you see he
when he could gain a modicum of
some of my agents in fourteen
places referred to were cities
tumult of rejoicing subsided immediately nevertheless cried
he tried to run away
sure would your daughter
n yawk if she s the
teach her a lot
things better than italian i know some
songs and i could hammer brass once
mr washington reached forward suddenly with his
instantly and there remained only that great
of the grating hey
you ain t goin away without givin
your blessing but mr washington
by the two boys was
hole of the golf course
though the pit and its
were no more than a hazard
not know that the little gold
et st mida which he
given her rested on
gave him such a look
he whispered her name
you say kismine she asked
thought she might have
neither of them had ever kissed
but in the course of an
highest tower they each lay awake happily
as possible 8 every
somnolent course games which john
john found mr washington a somewhat
aloof and reserved at all times she
apparently indifferent to her two
and entirely absorbed in
son percy with whom she
at dinner jasmine the elder daughter
hands and feet but was utterly
her in temperament her
kept house for widowed fathers
learned from kismine that jasmine
never recovered from the shock and disappointment
her by the termination
the world war just as she was
she had even pined
for a time and braddock washington

gardener they thought only in
this like this and that like
the problem of what

the night in a single
trying to agree upon the location

grief stunned with the
of this revelation john sat there open
feeling the nerves of his body
drying her dark blue eyes
she nodded in august usually
early in september it s only natural
how abominable how why i must

back toward the ch�teau they decided that

card room and pounded on the back
one of the under butlers which
a nervous jerk he sat
upright staring into the veils of somnolence
draped the room through the squares of
upon a bed of wind before identifying

just outside the room the click
then one of the veils seemed to
distorted like a reflection seen in a
of the cold water
half filled it he sprang
and his wet pyjamas scattering a
trickle of water behind
ran for the aquamarine
the magnificent sweep of the
stairways with a poignant
about him seeming to envelop
the solitary drenched little figure shivering upon
ivory landing then simultaneously two
happened the door of his
hall and as john swayed
slid back in the wall on
knees and displayed above the glow
executioners paused in their
all three of you quick
three negroes darted into
something portentous had occurred something which
the moment at least had postponed his
with bleak joyless eyes upon the
father s assistance and
occurred to john that this
his opportunity to join kismine
his wet pyjamas he returned to
with russian sable which led
kismine s suite the door of her
she turned toward him oh it

italian who got away simultaneously with
sharp cracks tumbled in through the open
to one of the electric
in an instant the entire chateau was
come on she cried
only a step to the tower
unger at last a minute later
had stepped out upon
to dismay as the
the valley became a
of deep reverberate sound
lurid light before long the aim of

last time through the
of the splendid halls they stood
burning negro quarters and
flaming embers of two planes which
fallen on the other side of the

seemed timorous about descending lower
its ethiopian crew john and the two
passed down the marble steps turned sharply
a heavily wooded spot half way up
they could lie concealed and yet be
a rocky gully 10 it was
trunk of a large tree
john and kismine sat his
around her and watched the
the ruins of a vista that
been a garden spot that morning
out of action in a swift
of red smoke though
moon was down they
the beleaguered possessed no further resources
some monster crouching in the grass the
stood dark and silent beautiful without
sun while the woody rattles
nemesis filled the air above
a growing and receding complaint
john perceived that kismine
her sister had fallen
the path they had lately followed
persons to whom they belonged
in the air now that was
of human origin and the
break soon john waited
the steps had gone a safe distance
trees fell away and a hard saddle
reached this point he slowed
above its edge his
braddock washington was standing there motionless silhouetted
sign of life as
earth it brought the solitary figure into
contrast with the new day
few moments absorbed in
inscrutable contemplation then he signalled
the two negroes who crouched at
feet to lift the burden which
between them as they
the air like a fragment of the
star the bearers staggered beneath
weight for a moment then their rippling
shine of the skins and
three figures were again motionless
their defiant impotency before the heavens after
while the white man lifted his
and slowly raised his arms
a gesture of attention as
who would call a
of rock began to speak ponderously
with an inextinguishable pride
might be men coming
be praying for a moment john
then the illusion passed there was something
the man s whole attitude antithetical
voice was become strong and
one into the other
impatience then a conviction commenced to
crept over him a spray
quick blood rushed through
arteries braddock washington was
a bribe to god that was it
of his slaves was some
sample a promise of
his sentences prometheus enriched
calling to witness forgotten sacrifices
rituals prayers obsolete before

plague gifts of myrrh and gold of
of children and queens
beasts of the forest and
lands that had been offered up in
or blood for his
buying a meed s worth
alleviation from the divine wrath
of diamonds king and priest

splendour and luxury would offer

wonderfully carved and equipped

ever changing radium which would burn
thing that for god
be absurdly easy only that matters
hour and that they
let but the heavens
swallowing these men and their
and then close again let him
and well there was no one else
or bargain he doubted
the price would be
pyramid constructed by ten
workmen would be like this
was his proposition everything would be up
could take it or leave it as
he lifted his head
seemed to him that a curious phenomenon
was as though the sky had
there had been a sudden
nature round about partook of this
the birds song ceased the trees were
mutter of dull menacing thunder that was
the wind died along
tall grasses of the valley
dawn and the day resumed their place
a time and the
bough was like a girl s
to accept the bribe for another moment
watched the triumph of
for him kismine sprang
on her parted lips but instinct
john that there was no
hand of each and
with light now and with the
mist behind them from
complaint of the peacocks far away and
pleasant of morning when
impendency clear against the
a broken white haired man was
by two gigantic and emotionless negroes who
still flashed and glittered in the
chateau and with rifles in
were starting up the diamond
watchers attention had stopped upon a
disappeared the white haired
two negroes the glittering
of whose jewelled head dresses
kismine clutched john s arm oh she
what are they going to do
must be some underground way of escape
little scream from the two
interrupted his sentence don
you see sobbed kismine hysterically
spoke john put up his hands to

blue smoke arose slowly carrying off with
what remained of vegetation
of human flesh of the

was silent you see don
again she made no answer
had been sound asleep for some time
surf when ardita reading in
favorite seat came to
last page of the revolt of the
and saw it she
a little cry of delight and
to carlyle who was standing moodily by
shoulders carelessly you ve got
he raised his voice and called up
the acting skipper oh babe

appeared from round the
of the deck house yas suh

he flushed and stiffened slightly
furious you were because you couldn
excuse me she said melting into
to having men regale

m the spirit of youth
beauty what do you tell
life is just a progression
and then a recession from one
i love you carlyle laughed and
t mean anything especially it s
oh she interrupted impatiently don
the morning it s a mild
of insanity a sort
as if to approach the island from
north there s a trick somewhere
ardita thoughtfully he can
well over a hundred feet
and not until they
by a curious overlapping of rock
walls then they were
and gold a gilded bay
the mirror lakes and
trees that children set
in sand piles not so
little coon knows his
exuberance was contagious and
fire hiding place lordy yes
carlyle as they landed in the slushy
south and brushing through a farther
a pearl gray virgin beach where ardita
of her brown golf shoes
stockings and went wading then
the indefatigable babe had luncheon ready for
though he doubted if the
to the cliff was generally known
name asked ardita the island i mean
the cliff and carlyle sketched for
hot after him by this time
he had pulled off and concerning
he still refused to
her he estimated as just under a
off southward keeping well
peru the details of coaling
to babe who it seemed
from cabin boy aboard
he d have been king of south
long ago said carlyle emphatically when
comes to intelligence he
booker t washington look like
moron he s got
blood is in his veins
the only man in the world who
play better ragtime than he can we
to sit together on the wharfs down
the new york water

that s the gos what
callao she interrupted take ship for india

after about five years appear in
a mysterious past but india first do

contradicted ardita reaching in her
for her cigarette case when i
it a man he started
mean you were engaged after a fashion
catherine of russia now don t mutter
about aristocracy she put in quickly i
him simply because he
had an imagination and the
courage of his convictions
uncle and a sillier aunt it seems
got into some scandal with
that counted and i d see to
with me he doesn t care for
attitude from anybody do you understand
he chuckled and then stopped
him i m sorry
i can t stand men
say i m sorry in
manly reserved tone just shut
she sat contentedly enjoying her
sea after a minute she crawled out
the rock and lay with
her reflected how it seemed impossible
her to assume an ungraceful attitude
lot of sort of ledges
heights we ll go swimming to
she said excitedly by moonlight
can use my uncle s
suit only it ll fit
a one piece that s
the natives all along the
i look cute too
shadowy blue and silver they threaded
shimmering channel in the rowboat and
diving platform there they sat
incessant surge of the waters almost stilled
know she went on i ve
thinking all day that you
successes i was an utterly devastating debutante
you were a prosperous musician just
corners were not rubbed
us require more for happiness
of my mouth and thinking i was
of transiency i wanted things now
i want to try
delightful looking sea she
shot out over the
blade in a perfect jack knife
used to read all day and most
the night i began
round on my back i ll be
in a minute let
tell you the only
quite impossible and quite charming to
york and getting into some
the most hellish scrapes imaginable the
of splashing mingled with her words
then he heard her hurried
rose and dived when he
quietly for a moment their arms
round their knees panting a little
something her eyes went
exultantly i found something carlyle waited and
enormous faith in myself
all my idols in
me i began separating courage from
other things of life all sorts of
cats and looking at them as
as i liked always and to die
my own way did
over and held a
for her gently still ardita continued the
magnificent proud tradition i d
up round me do
dull gray mist that comes
on life not only overriding
and circumstances but overriding
bleakness of living a sort of
up now and at her last
her head with the damp yellow hair
you were bred to that
attitude on my gray days even courage
one of the things that s gray
lifeless she was sitting
the edge hugging her
and gazing abstractedly at the
like a grotesque god into
and spontaneity and i feel that till
does i ve got to keep
eyes wide not necessarily any silly smiling
the female hell is deadlier
the male but supposing suggested
ten or fifteen feet above why
called back then i d
won he edged out till he
said quickly she laughed not i
she spread her arms
stood there swan like radiating a
going through the black
with our arms wide
we ll never hit the
she was in the air and carlyle
held his breath he
was nearly forty feet it seemed
compact sound as she reached the sea
it was with his glad
watery laughter curled up the
anxious ears that he
he loved her vi time having
axe to grind showered down upon
the port hole of
s cabin an hour after dawn she
cheerily donned her bathing suit and went
on deck the negroes would leave their
when they saw her
surface of the clear water again
the cool of the afternoon
on their sides in the sands of
southern beach talking little but watching the
fade colorfully and tragically into
sunny hours ardita s
of the episode as incidental madcap
strike off southward she dreaded all
rituals of her soul
seemed to run crosswise
every action but this is not a
isolation it is merely the presentation
setting among the palms of the
about ardita is the courage that
youth take me with you

their musical instruments and
love to reappear in ten

weaving in concentric circles
with their heads thrown back now

and jubilant sometimes haunting and plaintive
a death dance from the congo s

what kind of a ship

ardita s hand still
in carlyle s as it had when
were unaware of the contact but
he hurt her she made
attempt to remove it
before they reached the top and
you sure they know about

islet it s all up said
the yacht he said i prefer that

yacht by the silent negroes then
in the dim gray light the nose
the revenue boat appeared
the channel and stopped
fearing that the bay might be too
from the peaceful look
the yacht the man and the girl
the settees and the negroes
curiously against the rail they evidently
that there would be no resistance
two boats were lowered casually
the side one containing an
stern two gray haired

the russian inscription inside that
s your promised bracelet where where
earth it came out of
his six black buddies in
middle of their performance in the
this bracelet from a pretty overrouged woman

that s what you did you
well known bourgeois quality
said and then dawn
dynamically across the deck and
the dew rose and turned to
enveloping them until they
gossamer relics of the late
and dawn held a pink hand over
two graceful figures melted into
and he was kissing
second she smiled up at him happy
you her sigh was
she was youth and beauty
the two gray haired men the officer

lip slowly swell into that arrogant
savagely so this is
idea of of romance a runaway affair
at him carelessly what an
fool you are she said quietly is
she said as if considering
there s something else
past few years shut
and walked proudly down the
a sound from her
interviews he gave vent to
whole hearted amused chuckle in which

of rainbows did you find that

as he waited panic stricken for the
moreland and looked up at him
that it was entirely a
of your own brain i swear said
moreland eagerly she drew
head down and kissed him gently
to me just as
as you know how for the
of my life the negroes
floated drowsily back mingled in an
gladness and grief cling to
said and reaching up on
tiptoes she kissed him
dusty road street with a tolerant kindly
chin on a fifty
retained all the heat
sitting bolt upright at the wheel
a pained strained expression as though
squeaking indignantly at the encounter and
in front of the
a death rattle followed by a short
and then the air
rent by a startling whistle sally carrol
down sleepily she started to yawn but
from the window sill changed her mind
continued silently to regard the
whose owner sat brilliantly
been occupied in alternately
pleased and pleasant languor
and covered her bobbed corn
lay and left the room how
clark she inquired a minute
the side of the
go swimmin out to walley s
told marylyn we d call by an
her an joe ewing clark was
and lean and when on foot
his frequent smiles clark had

round the lazy streets of his
town discussing how he could

and danced with and made love to
all liked clark immensely when
company palled there were
a dozen other youths who were always
him in a few holes of
of hard yella licker every
york or philadelphia or pittsburgh to
into business but mostly they
stayed round in this
paradise of dreamy skies and firefly
road became a pavement along opiate
place where there were half
dozen prosperous substantial mansions and
the population idled casually across
front of a placid street car
the shops seemed only
their doors and blinking
windows in the sunshine
a fact that you
you met up in asheville last summer
carrol sighed never saw such an
marry a yankee sally carrol we need
round here sally carrol was silent a
i marry i offer my services honey
cheerfully anyway i know you too well

rambling dilapidated house marylyn wade
joe ewing appeared in

curious intensity don t you

there s the sleepy
s a sort of
the feeling that makes me
wild things that s
m not beautiful any more she
sighed oh sweet cooky as
eyes and tipping back her
till it rested on the
between tangled growths of bright
coppice and grass and tall
that sent sprays of foliage
road here and there
oldest white haired inhabitant smoking a corncob
wild grown grass in front
even the workers seemed
old tradition in the golden september
and round the drowsy picturesqueness over
trees and shacks and
rivers flowed the heat
hostile only comforting like a great
nourishing bosom for the infant
sally carrol cool water waitin
smiling ii in november harry bellamy
four days his intention was to
a matter that had
an evening in front
him loved him with that side
loving sally carrol had several rather clearly
sides on his last afternoon they
half unconsciously toward one of her
gray white and golden green
you mournful by nature harry
asked with a faint smile mournful not
mouldy for the fifties quaintly carved
flowers and jars for the
in sodden sleep on stone pillows and
they saw a kneeling figure
living minds they reached the top of
a tall round head stone freckled
1873 wasn t she
she died when she was twenty
dark i think and she always wore
sweet harry and she was the
of girl born to stand
to come back to her
stooped down close to the stone hunting
any record of marriage there s
not how could there be anything
unexpected lump came into his
her shoulders trembling a
an ambling breeze swept up the hill
s go down there
on the other side of the hill
along the green turf were
thousand grayish white crosses stretching in endless
dead said sally carrol
is the saddest see way over there
and her eyes brimmed with tears
can t tell you how real it
know how you feel about
is beautiful to me
to have live in me
were just men unimportant evidently or
for the most beautiful
in the world the dead south
see she continued her
have these dreams they
easy because it was all dead and
the last remnants of
courtliness and chivalry in some of
boys an stories i used to hear
and a few old darkies
harry there was something there
something i couldn t ever
t feel depressed do you lover even
get a sort of strength from
hand in hand they
beside her with their backs against the
clear out he complained i want
figures to move off and then
kissed him until the sky
of eternal seconds afterward they walked
at somnolent black and white checkers
the end of day you ll
up about mid january he
and you ve got to stay
if you ve never
parades on snow shoes they
knock out will i
cold harry she asked suddenly
certainly won t you may
guess i m a summer
i don t like any cold
very cold she rang for
porter to ask for another blanket and
he couldn t give her
she tried vainly by squeezing down into
bottom of her berth and doubling
the morning she rose at six and
coffee the snow had filtered
a slippery coating it was intriguing
seated in the diner she stared out
pines whose every branch
a green platter for
cold feast of snow sometimes a
farmhouse would fly by ugly and
compassion for the souls shut in there
for spring as she
rush of energy and
if she was feeling the bracing air
which harry had spoken this
at inquired the porter politely
said brush me off the long wires
three four came a
of white roofed houses
glimpse of a trolley car with frosted
streets more streets the city she stood
before she saw three fur bundled figures
sally carrol sally carrol dropped
bag hi a faintly familiar icy cold
emitting great clouds of
for harry and his wife
amid ricochets of half phrases exclamations
myra they swept each
a sedan bound through
wagons and automobiles oh
sally carrol i want
on a white lap of
big gray haired man of whom
approved and a lady
was like an egg and who
eggs and confusion and after
she was alone with harry in the
smoke it was a
room with a madonna over the
and rows upon rows of
in covers of light gold and
gold and shiny red all
one s head should
carrol had an instantaneous vision of the
old library at home with
the oil paintings of her three
been mended up for forty five
room with a lot of fairly
demanded harry eagerly does it surprise
is it what you expected i mean

brief kiss he seemed to
mean do you like it can you
she puffed at her cigarette
to ask you he began rather

sort of vulgar display at
go of course she

for instance there s one
who at present is about
things like that why said
goin to make remarks
a southern girl came
here last summer and said some

his lap half in the pillows
t got an idea whether i ll

she had the feeling for
the first time in her life
where the men seemed to do most

home they re a good looking crowd

junie morton he and the red
class why the best
in the world come from
a man s country i
you look at john

northwest and one of the greatest financiers
the country she turned suddenly to a
on her right i
name is sally carrol happer she said
yes i know harry told me you
professor oh she laughed at the university
eyes that had something in them that
other eyes lacked some quality
appreciation they exchanged stray sentences through dinner
she made up her mind to
same amount of half affectionate
young man after getting well started on
seemed to feel as though he
suggested that they sit
a while well he inquired
mighty fine how s how s
teach french but i ve been
really well why not don

so depressing oh it doesn t
all speak about the south being tragic
and daggers an haunting music he shook
head no the northern
are the tragic races they
t indulge in the cheering luxury
it s a dull subject he broke
of person who wants to be taken
as they rose it s encouraging
marrying for nine tenths of them
tip of her ear
ride at the back of
automobile through a chill
twilight swathed in furs she put
then land in a tangled laughing bundle
spent snow shoeing over a glaring plain
was only a reflection of her
at first the bellamy family puzzled
the men were reliable and she
dignity she took an immediate
and the new but
law seemed the essence
so utterly devoid of personality that
carrol who came from a
where a certain amount of
and assurance could be taken for
in the women was inclined to
they just fade out when
are the centre of every mixed group
there was mrs bellamy whom sally
egg with a cracked veiny voice
town in being innately hostile
strangers she called sally carrol
name was anything more
a tedious ridiculous nickname to
carrol this shortening of
loathed sally she knew also
harry s mother disapproved of her
hair and she had never dared smoke
visitor at the house he never again
in one day and found
peer gynt he laughed and told her
walking homeward between mounds of
piled snow and under a sun
sally carrol scarcely recognized they
a little girl done up
gray wool until she resembled a
teddy bear and sally carrol could
girl did you see
red as a little strawberry
she was cute why
own face is almost as red
him and had to
very morning suddenly their glances were
of them a man
standing there his knees
a tense expression as though he were
the chilly sky and then
both exploded into a shout of laughter
one on us she laughed he must
southerner judging by those trousers suggested
look must have irritated him those
re sort of sort of degenerates not
all like the old
they ve lived so long
there with all the colored people that
ve gotten lazy and shiftless hush
mouth harry she cried angrily they
but they re my best friends an
don t want to hear
some of em are the finest
in the world oh
know they re all right
they come north to college
slovenly lot i ever
clinching her gloved hands and biting her
one in my class at new haven
the son of a northern carpetbagger who
a southerner wouldn t talk

they haven t the
or the somethin else i m
sally carrol but i ve
you say yourself that

to any of the boys

thick sally carrol i
threw her arms round him oh
if we were married but harry being
be idiotic we decided on march
suppose i shouldn t have
that harry melted dear little nut he
come and kiss me and
felt something stronger and
enduring than her tears and smiles of
forward gripping the arms of
chair until her face grew crimson sort
of the violins and the
own old ghosts were marching by
nearly out of sight that
could have waved good
v it was a particularly cold night
filled the lower air
a fine particled mist there
the streets and was in
of lighted windows and muffling the
seemed to her as though
one lived here they had all
long ago leaving lighted houses
be covered in time by tombing
piles of it all
long where even her
there the long winter
the ceaseless glare through the
the crust forming on
spring of which roger patton had told
lilacs and the lazy sweetness it stirred
her heart she was laying away that
afterward she would lay away that
flakes melt quickly on
her complicated flannel cap then the small
came in skirmish line
she said quickly who the
oh no he isn
in sight of their destination on a
palace it was three stories
transparency of the great central
the fur robe it s beautiful
beautiful isn t it they
was a ghost and this
with pale faces and blurred snow filled
come on dear said harry she
waited while he hitched the horse a
of four gordon myra roger patton and
girl drew up beside them with
snow which was now so
yards away it s a
a muffled figure beside
covers six thousand square yards she caught
twenty to forty inches thick and
ice cave has almost a mile of
canuck who built it they found their
inside and dazed by the
of the great crystal walls sally carrol
two lines from kubla
of ice in the
glittering cavern with the
evening s oppression lifted harry was
it was beautiful and her gaze
for which had been selected for their
and dearness to obtain
opalescent translucent effect look here we
over to them in
muddled acoustics and then the
sweep over them sally
in the darkness and a dim
sighing complaint and from
drifted in the full
torches appeared and another
mackinawed figures swept in snow shoes slung
great walls the gray column
and another followed the light
luridly this time over red toboggan caps
flaming crimson mackinaws and as
entered they took up the refrain then
green of white of brown and yellow
white ones are the wacouta club whispered
eagerly those are the men you
the voices grew the great cavern
a phantasmagoria of torches waving in great
platoon deploys in front of
snow as the shout died the band
singing and then long
cheers by each club she sat very
of smoke went up
and there through the
council was over with the band
their head the clubs formed in
shouted harry we want
see the labyrinths down stairs before
turn the lights off they
rose and started toward the chute harry
sally carrol in the lead her
mitten buried in his big fur
that they had to
and their hands were parted before
realized what he intended harry harry had
rest of the party
shouted she had reached
turning point thirty feet down she heard
faint muffled answer far to
fled toward it she passed
turning two more yawning alleys harry
forward and then turned like lightning and
back the way she
icy terror she reached a turn was
here took the left
came to what should have
with no reverberations retracing her steps she
passage it was like the green
empty tombs she slipped a little now
she walked for ice
had to run her gloves along the
harry still no answer the sound she
the lights went out and
was in complete darkness she gave a
cold little heap on the ice she
as she fell but
scarcely noticed it as some
terror far greater than any fear of
was alone with this presence that
out of the north the dreary loneliness
strewn the whitened bones of
blindly down the darkness she
ice like corpses she had
of kept perfectly preserved
she had left with the others
they had said forty inches thick
walls she felt things
he would understand or
frozen heart body and
freeze up here she
a great weariness she felt
eyes dosing then some one seemed to
she looked up gratefully
softly to herself i knew
d come it really was
lee and she was
soft material that was quite comforting
was getting darker now and darker
those tombstones ought to be
moments that went fast and then
but seemed to be
of blurred rays converging toward
pale yellow sun she heard a
torch beyond that and another
some one had seized her and was
sally carrol it was dangerous
singing the torches the great shout of
s arms and gave a long low
oh i want to get out of
i m going back home take
s heart as he came
cried with delirious unstrained passion to morrow
sunlight poured a quite enervating
oddly comforting heat over
house where day long it faced the
stretch of road two birds were making
was april afternoon sally carrol happer resting
a very ancient ford
a perilous corner and rattle and groan
in a minute a strident familiar whistle
the air sally carrol smiled and
good mawnin a head appeared

childhood he had read papers
audiences learned that trick of
opening at the hippodrome
about this stunt you
if you can think
than taking a risk

tightly round his neck kiss me she
hear you say dear heart and
been wild for something
i could breathed marcia if i knew
enough i could write you the
love letter in the world and
get tired but after two more months
a very anxious weary looking young
who walked out before the hippodrome crowd
there were two days when
that young acrobat s face even when
was twisting breathlessly in the air an
swing after that performance he laughed at
the stairs to the flat five steps
carefully into a quiet
marcia he whispered hello

her eyes closed again and horace

moment with a look of
writing on the pages
constant mistakes in spelling and grammar
eyes he woke several times in the
for this desire of marcia
him there was something
first time in months he
mind his own half forgotten
he had meant to
popularize the new realism as
life took hold of people
forced them into flying rings
laughed to think of
hume marcia s threatened kiss

aloud in wonder as he
awake in the darkness i m
something tangible marcia with her written
and then taking what

its vocabulary it made an
appeal peter boyce wendell who happened at
an instalment for the serial publication

and the night i told him
up and said evylyn

as empty and as easy
his eyes were so black i

men said she was pretty no longer
this was probably because the

corners when she smiled that had added
the sadness of the eyes
of her lips turned up back in

impenetrable barrier dropped between them

she struggled up and jerked frantically

collar open and his
moving loosely what s

he looked at her bewildered sat half
get dressed he said
and pity for him rolled
her after all it was his
you d better iv if evylyn s
had hesitated an her
abrupt decision just afterward and completely left
her face suddenly deepened and
drawing her brows together
become an expression it
forty six as in
into a colorless antagonism in
toleration they might have felt
under the wearying depression of living
made more mistakes than
remark about the infantry
particularly dangerous there had
this was nothing out of the ordinary
never failed to make her nervous
up stairs so she stepped
of her youth it was astonishing to
that life had once been the sum
her current love affairs it
now the sum of her current
mother s shadow a pitiful little figure
to use but kept forlornly in
altogether but after the lessons
obedience to her mother the
were made without pockets but julie
experiment again the problem
on her lately the
bijou and the trip to europe
eighteen very very complicated she
noise in the library and started
was martha the middle
turned quickly oh i
no i she stood there fidgeting it
i put somewhere a letter

last mail the postman give it to
i must have stuck it somewhere
thought i d just slip in now
find it what sort of
letter from mr donald no it
in despair i can t
kitchen the dining room maybe
but turned suddenly at the sound
her brows drawn very
for a minute there was no
and fall of her
had put it there herself and
felt instinctively and unquestionably
the letter was it
name in ink on the outside
her soul s death within
her way along the
and through the doorway after
switched it on there was the bowl
ponderous and glittering grotesquely and
ominous she took a
and into the inside
fell on the rough cold surface in
fumbling with an obstinate fold
had seemed whirring buzzing a moment
then a grinding racket
of a water tap
in that instant it
marker in the insidious contest that had
listless interludes between evylyn
face she had long since forgotten with
massive brooding passivity it lay there in
the ice like beams of
thousand eyes perverse glitterings
now a very cruel smile as if
how hard and how beautiful
once you were just as cold
hard and beautiful the bowl
distend and swell until it became
room over the house and
evylyn saw that it was still
out out and far away from her
off far horizons and
and moons and stars except as
blots seen faintly through it and under
came through to them
light and light seemed shadow until
whole panoply of the world
changed and distorted under the
heaven of the bowl then there came
far away booming voice like a
then bounced toward her
and stronger than your
plans and i am how things
am the flight of time
the accidents and imperceptions and
the exception that proves no rules
the booming sound stopped
that bounded the world and up
the centre where they hummed for
moment and died then the
her growing smaller and smaller
to crush her and as
bruise of the cold glass
board shining and inscrutable reflecting
a hundred prisms myriad
colored glints and gleams and crossings and
a desperate frantic energy evylyn stretched both
arms around the bowl she
her dress had come apart from
hold her numb fingers
the block the crash was heard
all over the moonlit sidewalk around the
splinters of glass reflected
bobs her hair after
the first tee of
golf course and see

been about to cut in
this was not like the riotous
pleasantly warm and exciting where even the
waltzes and terrifying fox trots

a cigarette and strolled out onto the
semidark veranda where couples were scattered

irritation left with the last of the
to her swallowing her pride she turned
charley paulson and plunged do you
a sure and easy way of attracting
he didn t know much about bobbed
but bernice was there to tell him
see she announced coolly and went on
inform him that bobbed hair was
ask his advice because she
girls charley who knew as much about
the mental states of buddhist
felt vaguely flattered so
sevier hotel barber shop sit in the
chair and get my hair

coaching told and she
her paragraph to the vicinity
and encourage me i ll issue
for the inside seats there
a ripple of appreciative laughter
to her ear i
take a box right now she met
he had said something
brilliant do you believe in bobbed hair
g reece in the same undertone i
em or shock em marjorie had culled
from oscar wilde it
greeted with a ripple of laughter
the men and a series of
by overturning her water two hours
slowly upon him a
that bernice cousin to marjorie had
his eyes opened them
a visiting boy a matter easily accounted
no better but now she was dancing
more than three girls
effected the man relieved proved to
histrionically proficient can successfully counterfeit she looked
if she were having a good time
glisten so and that
thought her pretty when
been would be told emphatically that it
none of his business what
pity she was so
of him she basked in the
that no other girl in town interested
marjorie s affections was a labyrinth
he took a step out
me said warren but g reece had
stopped to apologize he had again cut
hall turned to take a
worked oh marjorie yes cried
i saw you were having a
time i did the only
of talk i had to repeat myself

said marjorie it the top
man cut in and he thinks
night good night as bernice
evening before her in review she
paulson cut in for the eighth
she had simulated delight and had
been both interested and
she had not talked about the
her school but had
churning drowsily in her brain after all
was she who had done
conversation but then marjorie
before marjorie dug it
said the words her own lips
evening nice boys like warren warren
v to bernice the next week was
revelation with the feeling that
really enjoyed looking at
and listening to her came
foundation of self confidence of course there
not know for instance
thought she was a quiet
she would not have
it first and powder my
and put on my hat
think that s the
have seen a connection it must
bathing an immoral subject and gave her
society but to offset that unfortunate
follow her with a puppylike devotion
the irritation of g reece stoddard several
whose afternoon calls otis completely ruined by
her the story of the
with a slight sinking sensation of
bobbing of her hair
the hair bobbed day
to morrow maybe she would reply
will you come and see me because
will we you know but you
laugh again pretty soon now
d be surprised but
the harvey house at first the
maid was distinctly startled when he
marjorie perhaps it was the familiar though
collective mind of the younger set knew
had made an amazing face about and
giving an indisputable rush
marjorie s guest the question of
take it warren called bernice on
not he was sincere marjorie on
had at last found some one
appreciated him so the
at that one afternoon when
warren with whom she was going to
bridge party she was in rather a
for the party appeared beside her
began casually to adjust her hat in
mirror bernice was utterly
you may as well get
what bernice was utterly
you may as well
making a fool of yourself over
mcintyre he doesn t care a snap
a tense moment they regarded
astounded half angry half afraid then
house and there was a riotous honking
of them gasped faintly turned and side
had offended marjorie the sphinx of
with the most wholesome
and the conversation became
the storm gradually broke little
some one had asked me day bernice
her hair bobbed then your
attack her imagination was paralyzed there
a lot of bluffs in the
continued marjorie quite pleasantly i should think
her latest bon mot no one
to know in fact bernice
nothing memorable of late was that really
cousin s suddenly frigid eyes she
she stalled splush said marjorie
left a ukulele he had
steadily her cheeks were glowing
her a question and
intend to bob mine when demanded marjorie
time no time like the
his feet good stuff he
out come on bernice cried otis
i don t care if
do an eternity of minutes later riding
town through the late
s car close behind bernice had
she wondered why she did not cry
mistake it was all she could do
bands to protect it from the suddenly
even the thought of her mother was
the shop which presented two
and looked at the sign
and the hangman was the first
he must have been waiting all week
eternal cigarettes beside that portentous
often mentioned first chair would they
neck lest any of her blood nonsense
should get on her clothes
she crossed the sidewalk
riotous row that occupied the waiting
went up to the fat barber
want you to bob my hair the
barber s mouth slid
open his cigarette dropped to the floor
took her seat on high a man
his side and gave her a glance
and spoiled little willy schuneman s monthly
mr o reilly in the last chair
bernice didn t care for a shine
a passer by stopped and
his fingers were fumbling clumsily with
her back for a
she was near breaking
and then the picture before
swam mechanically into her
marjorie s mouth curling in a
up and get down you tried
buck me and i called your
a curious narrowing of her eyes that
remarked on to some
long afterward twenty minutes later the
swung her round to face the
of the damage that had been
her hair was not curls
now it lay in lank
her suddenly pale face it
ugly as sin she
as sin her face s
miserably she saw two
s mouth curved in attenuated mockery
a half hearted sure from
or three voices another awkward pause and
marjorie turned swiftly and with serpentlike intensity
she asked i ve simply got to
s driving right home and
abstractedly at some infinite speck out the
rested coldly on bernice before they
said slowly vi bernice did
set for her until she met
you no but what
the deyo s dance you should have
that it was sudden aunt
anyway why does it
the foibles of the younger generation
bobbed hair it s her
abomination and the dance
for you and marjorie i m
m sorry dinner was an agony she
aunt was both worried
bernice made a listless unsuccessful attempt
entertain the two others sighed thankfully as
climbed the stairs to her room
half past ten what a day when
she said i m awfully
you my word of honor i d
she passed her comb slowly through her
look slick i didn t imagine
i suppose it won t
her own hair over her shoulders
into two long blond braids until
bernice remained this relic and
see g reece stoddard
telling his dinner partner that bernice shouldn
see draycott deyo exchanging glances with
mother and then being conscientiously charitable to
but then perhaps by to
mrs deyo would have heard the
would send round an
fail to appear and
her back they would all laugh
of her that her chance
cheek i like it she
with an effort i
it ll be becoming marjorie
it looks all right for
night bernice but as the door closed
snapped within bernice she sprang dynamically to
and from underneath it dragged
her suitcase into it she tossed toilet
and a change of
then she turned to her trunk
lingerie and stammer dresses
out sitting down at her desk
wrote a short note to
harvey in which she briefly outlined
that if she walked
away she could easily
eyes that a practiced character reader might
worn in the barber
chair somehow a development of it it
that lay there and
out all the lights stood
until her eyes became accustomed to the
softly she pushed open the door
marjorie s room she
bedside now very deliberate and calm she
of the braids of marjorie
slack so that the
her sleep bernice deftly amputated
her own room down stairs
stepped off the porch into the moonlight
bag after a minute
braids she laughed unexpectedly had to shut
house now and on
piece of rope flung them
the wooden porch where they landed
a slight thud she laughed again
crowded so lois was forced to stand
large lady s day message to
words or the fatal fifty one
waiting decided she wasn t quite sure
the address so she
the letter out of her bag
ran over it again darling
began i understand and i m happier
could give you the things
marry and we can t lose each
nothing until your letter came dear i
having lost you where the crumbling
in wilmington till then i
be here just waiting and
for every long dream of
to come true howard she had
that she knew it word by word
it still startled her
reflections of the man who
excitement she felt sometimes when he
the large lady and
words lois took a blank and wrote
her decision it s just destiny
things work out in this damn world
cowardice is all that s been
me back there won t be any
just let things take their course and
be sorry the clerk
day with my brother meet me wilmington
and never be sorry thought
and never be sorry ii
filtering light onto dapple

many yellow fields dark opaque
for flowered bushes or wild climbing
some of the trees were very gay
the monastery which by true monastic standards
and as a matter of
brothers were sweating lustily as
in front as a great mellow bell
the half hour a swarm of
human leaves were blown over
cheeks furrowed like the first
was a scattering of middle aged leaves
forms when viewed in profile in their
unsymmetrical these carried thick
cardinal mercier and immanuel kant and many
note books filled with lecture data
most numerous were the
leaves blond boys of nineteen with very
having taught out in the world for
years several hundreds of them from city
town and country in maryland and
in arm with each other
twos and threes or
for this was the society of

it and not argue lois got
her in a street car they
expensively appropriate travelling affair she
either side her face
very eager and expectant yet she hadn
that girls wear when they arrive for
senior prom at princeton
new haven still as there were no
proms here perhaps it didn t matter
look like whether she d
know him from his
well developed mouth and
that he had already made a
he was thirty six didn
shots he was much
and his hair had
a little thin but the
wouldn t be for
year lois had an idea
this was all going to be rather
if she let it be but
had a nervous breakdown or
saw a man break
away from a group
wonderful i can t tell you
why lois you re beautiful lois
first use of his name lois
minute because i want you to meet
around i have a
not intended to say at all
little jovial white haired
who retained her hand
priests arrived enthusiastically and shook
with her and addressed her
she didn t mind a
certain shyness reserve at least
she appreciated because of course they weren
the father rector had called him
and one of the
she was shaking hands again and promising
come back a little later for some
absurdly happy she told
in showing her off
you before we go any farther how
come up here i think it was
plan of taking the hot journey
thing why kieth she said
you know i couldn
have waited a day
was five but of course i didn
general idea what you and mother did
europe those fourteen years and then
when you had pneumonia and couldn t
down with mother let s see that
but it s all been
personality of every man she met she
that he gave was bred by
said it as if he
inherent meaning to him then
mother wanted me to go to
convent but i didn
want to she cast
side glance at him
see if he would resent
enough convents abroad eh yes and kieth
are different there anyway here
first lois though i wouldn t say
them of course were fine the sort
for instance i hated the fellow
sort of man you d
like to have with her in
asked rather shyly to come
story about the pullman car oh that
looked rather annoyed tell me
i d like to
i d been riding all day
sense that some one was
he d been there for
out oh my god not that
and crawled up the
flight of stairs to
another silence and lois saw that her
that he was staring unseeingly out over
sunny fields she was
by the modulations of his voice
with the green left out
was it that the
had grown up to
lately he was getting a
bald just on top of his
she wondered if that
from wearing a hat so much it
were you religious if you don
mind these personal questions
sober lois thrilled slightly did you
tell me about mother i know it
know you ve had to sacrifice
want you to know how fine of
how little she had sacrificed how
invalid mother youth shouldn t be
to age kieth she
on your shoulders child i
turned her remark and instantly she knew
was sweet her thoughts
confusion i didn t
a man named freddy kebble
oh i don t know i
that a man named howard
didn t yet i didn t know
i meant just the
i suppose real sweetness is
i ve known old priests who had
sprawled full length on the grass
these young men happy here
suppose so but those young ones
laughed no but they will be
month permanently yes unless
break down mentally or
of course in a discipline like
a lot drop out but those boys
they giving up fine
some of them but
any experience of what they re
just sort of scared them
first do they all come in so
lives regan for instance i
sure that knocking about gives a
the sort of experience he
you thank so lois she nodded still
s a sort of
in guilt lois after
old mother no i
t think that to
show yourself at all real
people want human sympathy objected lois they
to feel the other person
s what they mean by human here
smile they try to get all
at the first they put us
scrubbing floors and other things it s
that idea of saving your
a man is in your sense
to humanity we carry
and he looked at her with a
brightness in his gray eyes but way
with my little sister
a sudden impulse she knelt beside him
kissed his forehead you
i love you for
and you re sweet iii back
there was a young man
looking who she knew must be
home and she mentally
of his riotous uncles
there was regan with a
face and piercing intent eyes
and often rested on
man to have with you in a
he s the missionary type she
s sister to show us
man with a broad grin
laughed i m afraid
out the gate besides i m
things like shimmys they were just starting
do the maxixe wasn t it jimmy
you d see him when
the bucket and making irreligious motions
laugh in which lois joined an
lady who comes here to mass sent
pretty good isn t it there
tears trembling in lois
the gleaming monstrance with its central
through the stained glass window of
tracery on the cassock of the man
front of her but at the
notes of the o salutaris hostia a
and a curious set expression
their eyes she shivered slightly they were
dead men she felt her soul recede
brother this this unnatural person she caught
in the act of
she fidgeted and raising
hand to her hair
deuce again she repressed a
laugh and then in
instant the weight on her heart
diffused into cold fear it
that candle on the altar
of it taking form and shape above
it was the wick if the wick
her brain and as
an enormous terrified repulsion she
jarvis something in that candle she was
t any one see
anyone ugh she felt a space
her and something told
that jarvis had gasped and
down very suddenly then she was
and as the flaming
her ears the crash of the bells
that seemed eternal a great torrent rolled
was calling felt herself calling for kieth
became aware of a new presence
external in front of her consummated
expressed in warm red tracery then she
it finally and she
herself calling again endlessly impotently kieth
then out of a great stillness came
voice blessed be god
her heart the incense lay mystically and
on the altar went
blessed be his holy name blessed be
on her feet and reeled backward
still child she closed
grass outside pillowed on
s arm and regan was dabbing
all right she said quietly i
it was too hot in there
again touched her gingerly
the towel i m all
falling her mind and
her stripped soul up and
vi half an hour later she walked
the long central path toward the gate
s been such a short afternoon he
and i m so sorry you
fine now really i wish you wouldn
guess the truth is i m not
my religious exertions she
i can t tell
is it really doesn t seem to
any more as far
morals go some of the wildest
the ones who think and read
t be here for another half
path for instance gerald carter he s
seems so so narrow
freedom about things that catholic
control kieth winced almost
quickly everybody talks about everything now it
i just wanted to tell you why
at present i m not
you think we all go
those times but i know it
want you to pray for me sometimes
i think your prayers
be about what i need
to you now than to
one in the world
stopped suddenly and indicated the
knees beside him and made
was only half through when he rose
her for letting as have
day together he said simply lois
a sudden lump in her throat
voice trembling a little this
i expected you re just what
expected lois i m
in socks playing on the beach with
suddenly as a wistful
to build dreams about you a
i think lois it was your
white soul i tried to keep near
see your baby soul flitting
ahead of me very
was crying softly they had reached the
i knelt all one night
asked god to spare
i wanted some day to take your
she sobbed you know
say you know it oh
she put her hands
her tear wet face against his
and smile bravely at him as the
kicked his whip and the bus
of dust rose around it and she
gone for a few minutes he stood
post his lips half
in a smile lois
said aloud in a sort of wonder
coming back after a time found him
there and he was there until twilight
garrulous overhead and the crickets took
their burden of song in the dusky
pretty one with the big black dots
gone you missed somep n what about
nothing cept she s
a minute ago she came in
a telegram all written out and
standin there goin to give
them over his shoulder
tore it up eh said
s essays and samuel butler s
and marcus aurelius it will
neither cheerful nor pleasant but will
numerous passages of striking humor
until they ve experienced it its
will be purely relative all
over thirty will refer
to the story of

played the star in an affair
included a lewis gun and a nine
a row of medals and on his
in the states he was told
he was second in importance only
was a lot of fun
his home town there were old
the rims of whose eyes grew
his father s business went blah in
twelve but when the
the mayor that he had only fourteen
legends of this state was already
there very quietly and obscurely
door he heard the up stairs
talking to the cook
s boarding house dalyrimple
behind him some mid victorian
and a thin packet of folded paper
examiners a trick of
some time before and a cool hand
a hot situation but these things
not save him a final unresigned
was early afternoon when he walked
smile theron g macy greeted him warmly
admission his own words
they came sounded like an arab
s whine for alms why this
seemed somehow more clothed than just a
mr macy continued dalyrimple i feel i
his staff i was
of counting on that for a
i paid my own way
and i found he meant a
said something one day he paused
waited for the older
to take him up but noting
throat again you ve
quite a while yes i suppose i
hurry and i d had these various
ranch two summers as a
give you a chance
the stock then you ll come
begin how about to
all right report to mr hanson
the latter realizing that
interview was over rose
obliged that s all right
to help you bryan
an irresolute moment dalyrimple
the room had not been hot why
devil did i thank the son
hanson informed him coldly of
necessity of punching the time clock
charley was twenty six with that faint
often mistaken for the scent of
decide that he had drifted
he was pale and
his last intrigue or forward to his
one in his youth his taste
in hands and indeterminate gray collars
theron g macy company it s a
give me i m quittin in a
charley moores are always going
one to the infinite disparagement
sixty this rather defiantly did you
at sixty me no i
all how long ve
been here asked dalyrimple with a sinking
he resented the time clock and he

in his second week the
time he d be reported to mr

and carrying boxes through damp
walled corridors lost in that
half darkness between seven

until nine at night at the end
a month he stood in line and
forty dollars he pawned
to eat sleep and smoke
brought no increase he voiced his alarm
with old macy maybe
s disheartening reply but he didn
to live said dalyrimple simply i could
more pay as a laborer on
chance to get ahead charles
answer next day was equally unsatisfactory dalyrimple
gone to the office
to you why yes
unhumorous smile appeared the voice vas
ll speak to mr hanson
sir while i m here i d
of course it takes

days later he again appeared
the office with the
for by mr hesse the bookkeeper
hesse was engaged and
waiting began idly fingering in a

he turned a page he
sight of his name it
he had been out of the packing

on the road dangled before his eyes
a moment when a genii
and assimilated filled his mind get on
hesse or charley moore i
then walked up to the desk here
that data he said brusquely i can
wait any longer mr hesse

so he got out of

covering his face with

with furious brown rivulets that splashed and

necessarily rewarded that honest poverty

after you then he stood there
scurried away into the night
into his pocket snatched
darted down an alley iv yet however
many bad moments in
weeks immediately following his
the tremendous pressure of sentiment and inherited
morally lonely the noon after his first
he ate in a
to the sporting sheet read doctor
s crop of seasoned
to focus playing a lifeless

failure with a great surge of
broke the laws of justice
byronic now not the spiritual
faust but a new psychological
own mind happiness was what
wanted a slowly rising scale of
swinging litheness his muscles were rippling smoothly
an absurd desire to bound along the
air lay a faint
of acerbity inspirational rather than
the clock he laughed
beauty he passed a man and
he was on philmore street now and
was very dark he blessed the city
posts as a recent budget had recommended
the dents the markhams
frasers the hawkins where he

maids between the imposing fronts of
macys and the krupstadts the craigs ah
he paused wavered violently far up
a lamp post across a lawn
standing tense without breath or
of it in the shadow of his
mile off a cat howled a
yards away another took up the
swoop acting as shock absorber
his mind there were other sounds
laughter from a back
he did not know who lived here
the steel softened and his nerves became
he gratefully found them supple and
fall by chance nor be a serious
his coat pocket took out his pocket
the dining room had never
too small to permit disposing
vaguest he had found that
a mind like his
was best to have but the
that a method preconceived would give
two points of view in
crisis and two points of view
automatically at the third

pitted against that same moral pressure a
had never felt this
the stairs came to an end a
approached he went in and listened to
of steps and his body swayed
could not have enumerated them ten
afterward he felt on a
for possible trousers found
corners of his mouth smiled mechanically another
that sent his heart
bills stick pins two
own wrist watch on his outstretched arm
the stairs he skipped two crumbing steps
practically safe as he neared the
he felt a slight boredom he reached
dining room considered the silver
decided against it back
his room at the
house he examined the additions
his personal property sixty
seven hundred dollars diamonds were
red cloth case containing a set of
teeth a silver watch
gold chain worth more
the watch an empty ring box a
desk ornament a dollar and sixty
under his pillow and the other
then for two hours
and there through his
the burglary failed to mention the false
soft toothless breakfast of a strange hollow
a great fatherly pity in him trying
ascertain whether they belonged to a
carefully out of the case
mouthed man on a warm
and printed false teeth
the package in clumsy
they knew that the burglar was
town however they didn t
end of a month
but though dalyrimple had only committed
laid eyes on mrs henry coleman
could not have been expected
recognize bryan dalyrimple at
fourth of july and whom she
described as not at
great unexpected horrors and depressions would
him then for reassurance he had
it was on the
better to give up considering himself as
rebel it was more
as a fool his
the store ended he found himself regarding
his future he had the intention of
half a dozen times
hadn t would he please call on
dalyrimple s wonder was
were not his cue to take the
an hour s consideration decided
to be the biggest
influence in the city his brother was
an objectionable boss was
nevertheless he had a great huge
deep set eyes and a
a smile reached a cheerful
and then receded back
laid holding out his hand
i wanted you sit
are you i m twenty three you
young but that doesn
long i m going to make
the beginning i ve been watching
cup dalyrimple murmured disparagingly but fraser waved
to silence it was a speech i
to everybody in that
if tempted to digress on his knowledge
seen too many young men
ideas and not enough
see what you d do
you started dalyrimple felt a
settle over him so continued fraser when
the first month i
good for your job hinting around
that s the stuff i
in a young man that s
how much harder it was
young and strangely ingenuous
senate we want a young man
has got brains but
solid and not a loafer and when
here dalyrimple we ve got to

expression had now reached the
mentally on but it stopped locked
slid from him the barn door

dalyrimple started at this repetition
much lately there was a sudden
up suddenly the state
the united states senate so life
this after all cutting
never to let remorse or self reproach
him a night s sleep let
there was no payment
some telepathy between them
made this new appreciation possible
in this scheme i ve been for
felt a whimsical moisture
the present time no one i know
samuel meredith possibly this is
others by mutterings about takin a poke
landin a swift smash in ee
was it not the shape
earliest youth broad bowed with gray
ashamed to tell them the
he was fourteen he
been brought up on
diet of caviar and bell boys legs
half the capitals of
that his mother had nervous prostration
to less tender less biassed hands
roommate named gilly hood gilly was
undersized and rather the
master samuel gilly cried
that the faculty had played him
he felt like an irate frog
said no they re
matter and i said who said
did let him get fresh with me
gilly s personal friends
french phrases in conversation endured a
enough to him then a storm broke
the aquarium samuel was out
me you bet he won t
open those windows i
but the darn fool
the morning make him gilly why
fierce agreement don t you
he needn t think i m any
make him at this point the darn
the crowd in one
his irritating smiles two boys
would you mind not sitting
my bed he suggested politely
two of gilly s particulars who were
very much at ease huh my bed
to injury there were several
interrupted this sentence by rising and
up to samuel he paused several
away and eyed him fiercely
it s my bed he got no
for gilly hauled of and hit
succinctly in the nose yea
show the big bully just let
the group closed in on
and for the first time in
he towered a head taller than his
so if he hit back he d
called a bully and have
a dozen more fights on his hands
five minutes yet if he
bracketed the thirty most miserable
of his life every waking moment he
for intolerable witticisms and of course
thorn he considered that
unpopularity at school would follow
through life when he went
the discreet attitude he made good use
the clean start given
by the shortness of
constant companion gilly hood
appreciated the social importance of football games
believed passionately in good form his choosing
gloves his tying of ties his holding
reins were imitated by impressionable freshmen outside
without being gentlemen or merely
brought home several of his friends
course the proper thing
any one of samuel s
standing lady with a formal bow one
in samuel s junior year he
a car with two of
when samuel sat down
noticed a heavy eyed laboring
sitting next to him
smelt objectionably of garlic sagged slightly against
will took up quite too much
the car had gone
blocks when it stopped for a quartet
young girls and of course the three
of the world sprang to their
and proffered their seats with due observance
form unfortunately the laborer being unacquainted
the code of neckties
tallyhos failed to follow
glared reproachfully at the
conduct samuel was the most violently
he was humiliated that any male
sternly that should have been
pay my fare he said quietly
the conductor was looking their
so at a warning nod
gloom they reached their destination
swinging his little pail seeing his
the lower animals to ride with human
dropped his pail and
sprawled full length into
cobblestone gutter don t laugh
hell as he spoke
up his pail samuel s friends took
quick step in his
then he remembered gilly hood in the
andover was before his eyes and he
intuitively that he had been wrong again
ve been a damn fool of
it took more than an hour
on the essential importance of
his wrongness had made him powerless as
eventually his mistake about the
influenced his entire attitude snobbishness is after
merely good breeding grown
so samuel s code remained but the
in the reflected glory
his neckties so they declaimed
ten dollars for the paper which
him irretrievably educated and sent him into
time started back to shirt sleeves
and it had already unbuttoned
that exquisite tabula rasa
a university education sometimes leaves
he had both energy
as a dodging half back in
through wall street crowds
there were half a dozen two or
debutantes an actress in a
way a grass widow and one sentimental
he bad been working
just to shop she
like this she laughed
cheery young laugh oh
me no we were to
for dinner but i
have misunderstood the place
ll be awfully worried well
samuel disapprovingly he ought to
you home she accepted his offer
so they took the
had arrived before her he s
jealous she announced laughingly apologetic
well answered samuel rather stiffly
left her that would have
chatted like old friends she was going
her dressmaker s eat lunch alone
a very lucky man she blushed again
scurried off samuel whistled all the
see that pathetic appealing little mouth
he lunched and the heavy
at taine s with the brown
and the mouth a few feet
car she was quite
to see him why hello she
samuel could tell that she
just pleasantly frightened i thought
might lunch together it s
s no harm in
how could there be it occurred to
much better looking he was
and expected to be rich
s grass widow had been in a
in this meeting so
they made another engagement in fact
a month they lunched together two
three times a week
presence outside this grew to
a ceremony and it
and marjorie didn t invite him
was worth he was
had said that morning and he was
friend when he took her
call on me remember that
am always waiting always waiting she
until the gas went on
warned him that at
he and marjorie had
there is usually so much mud
seldom see to the bottom every
marjorie s husband took to staying in
york until late at night
must have had too much
husband was after all pretty decent so
drifted on from one misunderstanding to
marjorie kept coming more
accept masculine sympathy at is much more
to her than crying to another
had begun to rely on him how
away when marjorie went in and
sofa in the little
and he felt that the man
stubborn pride was a fool and unworthy
she cried softly and told
to go he sailed
to fan this spark of romance
matter how big the blaze
who was burned at the
more than the white screen in a
picture it was just samuel
his arms and feel that she was
they kissed until both their hearts
a hand tried the outside door marjorie
in angry impatience at the interruption he
to the front door
seen them so often that when they
happen people behave very much like actors
if daring him to doubt it
s husband spoke of the sanctity
t seemed very holy to him lately
he stopped and scrutinized both of them
a consciously heroic pose go up
different tone stay where you are samuel
quickly marjorie rose wavered and
the stairs come outside said her
to samuel i want to talk to
samuel glanced at marjorie
and went out there
a bright moon and when marjorie
husband came down the steps samuel could
for him they stood and looked
as samuel slumped to the
the incident altered like
to his feet and squared off the
had miraculously and entirely changed
now he seemed the cad
against the lights of
there was a pause and
samuel turned quickly away and went
andover had landed on his personal unpleasantness
women out of his ken
a year later when he met
s husband had protected
samuel could not imagine his grass widow
thirties found him well on his
was in those days a national figure
watched the son for
he controlled at that time mines
him knew his likes and dislikes
prejudices weaknesses and many strengths one
closing the door of his inner
cigar everything 0 k
afraid you re getting a bit stale
samuel was puzzled you ve done
ten years but i ve had vacations
i mean outside work seeing
things move that we
t so he said abruptly i m
that ll take about a month
didn t argue he rather liked the
and he made up his
it through just as carhart
greatest hobby and the men around him
you ll go to
never met samuel had had much official
better go to morrow answered carhart glancing
the calendar that s the 1st of

sea and samuel s
little village near pueblo

a question of sitting at
wheel and keeping a firm
much greater clear gain
any dealing in the open market
shook hands with hamil arranged to return
carhart was trying him out
of this might be a
in something big for him but
through ten years in
and a little bit more
enthusiasm but each one
holding out as flies on
d talked it over argued it with
and couldn t see any
oil the other twelve were part of
chance but quite as
to hamil s purpose in
leader was an early settler named mcintyre
but it was in
pool and if any man hated
lose his land mcintyre did
means with which to do it
he had failed and
would appear it came a
could not help respecting the man
the little flicker of envy that
people feel toward men who
and his hands on his
and he hardly blamed him mcintyre
briskly if this half hour is
talk oh dry up young man mcintyre
this samuel made no
it s simply a dirty filch
liberally offered samuel shut
roared mcintyre suddenly i want
privilege of talking he
wherever you do your
do no critter gets so low that
doesn t sort of
had in him samuel watched him awkwardly
wiped his forehead with a
million i reckon we
s blotted out to buy
waved his hand toward the door i
wings and with four mangy
saw the sun come

said mr mcintyre has been kind

operator into complete unfitness for business
one was to peter

dismal miserable failure but some instinct
him stronger than will deeper
training had forced him to do what
probably end his ambitions
his happiness but it was done

a man s voice called from

mildewy inside of the
disagreeable smell and its obscurity was

sir that way sir if you
gentleman s boots in
barber to concord stir about there now
to a passenger by the mail
foot the room had
odd interest for the establishment of
royal george that although
into it all kinds
another drawer and two porters
all loitering by accident at various
of the road between
concord and the coffee room
a gentleman of sixty
dressed in a brown
of clothes pretty well
flaps to the pockets passed
on his way to his
the coffee room had no
he looked with a hand on each
sermon under his flapped waist coat as
against the levity and evanescence of
and was a little vain of
for his brown stockings fitted sleek and
and were of a fine texture his
and buckles too though plain were trim
wore an odd little sleek crisp flaxen
wig it is to be presumed
made of hair but which looked far
with his stockings was as white as
upon the neighbouring beach
the specks of sail that glinted in
sunlight far at sea a face
years gone by some pains to drill
anxiety but perhaps the confidential bachelor clerks
tellson s bank were principally occupied with
second hand cares like second hand clothes
easily off and on completing his
portrait mr lorry dropped off to
chair to it i wish
prepared for a young lady who may
here at any time to day she
let me know yes
yes sir we have oftentimes
of travelling sir in tellson and
an english one yes sir not much
i think sir not of late years
is fifteen years since
would hold a pretty
sir that a house like tellson
not to speak of fifteen
be far from the truth
sir rounding his mouth and both
eyes as he stepped backward
the table the waiter shifted his
from his right arm to his left
into a comfortable attitude
to the immemorial usage of
in all ages when mr lorry had
his breakfast he went
little narrow crooked town of dover
and ran its head into the
tumbling wildly about and the sea did
it liked and what
liked was destruction it thundered at
town and thundered at the cliffs
brought the coast down madly the
among the houses was
so strong a piscatory
dipped in it as
people went down to be dipped in
done in the port and a
particularly at those times when
tradesmen who did no business whatever
lamplighter as the day declined into
at intervals clear enough to allow the
charged with mist and vapour
when it was dark
room fire awaiting his dinner
the red coals no harm
complete an appearance of satisfaction as is
gentleman of a fresh complexion
has got to the end of a
untouched this is mam selle
minutes the waiter came
see the gentleman from tellson s
if it suited his pleasure and
empty his glass with
it was a large dark room furnished
a funereal manner with black horsehair and
with heavy dark tables these had been
and oiled until the
tall candles on the
in the middle of the
were gloomily reflected on
graves of black mahogany and
light to speak of could be
over the well worn
until having got past the two tall
more than seventeen in a riding
and still holding her straw travelling hat
his eyes rested on a short
pretty figure a quantity of golden hair
pair of blue eyes that
his own with an inquiring look and
knitting itself into an
that was not quite one of perplexity
of a bright fixed
had held in his arms
the passage across that very channel one
sea ran high the likeness passed away
hospital procession of negro cupids
fruit to black divinities of the feminine
and he made his formal bow to
lorry with the manners
an earlier date as he
i received a letter from
material miss either word will do respecting
whom i never saw so
cast a troubled look towards
it necessary that i should go
be despatched to paris for the purpose
sir she curtseyed to
young ladies made curtseys
much older and wiser he was
highly if i might be
that worthy gentleman s protection
gentleman had left london but
his waiting for me here i
with the charge i shall be
was told me by the
details of the business and
i must prepare myself to
them of a surprising nature i have
my best to prepare
and i naturally have a strong
naturally said mr lorry
i after a pause
added again settling the crisp flaxen wig
the ears it is very
into that singular expression but it
shadow are you quite a stranger
an argumentative smile between
eyebrows and just over the little
the expression deepened itself as she
her seat thoughtfully in the chair
on in your adopted
man of business i have a
you miss the story of
of our customers story he
wilfully to mistake the word she had
in the banking business we
man of great acquirements a doctor
of beauvais why yes of
paris i had the honour
relations but confidential i was
at that time i may ask at
time sir i speak
of twenty years ago he
affairs like the affairs
i have been trustee
scores of our customers these are
business relations miss there is no
in them no particular interest nothing like
i have passed from one to another
our customers to another in the
of my business day in
machine to go on but this
my father s story sir and i
very intent upon him
when i was left an
through my mother s surviving
father only two years it was you
am almost sure it was
young lady straightway to her chair again
holding the chair back with
now in saying i had
feelings and that all the relations i
with my fellow creatures are mere
house since and i have been
since feelings i have no time for
no chance of them i pass
pecuniary mangle after this odd description
his daily routine of employment mr
flattened his flaxen wig
his head with both hands which was
unnecessary for nothing could be flatter than
shining surface was before
now comes the difference if
father had not died
she caught his wrist with both her
the back of the
fingers that clasped him
business as i was saying
look so discomposed him that he
wandered and began anew
died if he had suddenly
difficult to guess to
an enemy in some compatriot
could exercise a privilege that
boldest people afraid to speak of in
for instance the privilege of filling up
the oblivion of a
for any length of time
quite in vain then the history
your father would have been the
me more sir i
that s good though his
was less satisfied than his
matter of business business
intensely from this cause before
to the determination of sparing the poor
the inheritance of any part
the truth o dear
a matter of business you confuse me
confused let us be
i should be so much more
without directly answering to this appeal
raised her and the hands
had not ceased to clasp his
been that she communicated some reassurance to
useful business miss manette your mother took
course with you and when she
her unavailing search for your father she

on the flowing golden hair as
have been already tinged with grey you
that your parents had no great possession

property but he felt his wrist
closer and he stopped the expression in

it is too probable almost a
been taken to the house

i can you to restore
a low distinct awe stricken
ghost it will be
chafed the hands that held his arm
now the best and
the poor wronged gentleman and with
soon at his dear side she repeated
the same tone sunk
a whisper i have been free
have been happy yet
attention he has been found
another name his own long
be worse than useless
been for years overlooked or always
would be dangerous better
in any way and to
important as they are to french credit
i carry about me
a scrap of writing openly referring to
are all comprehended in the
she sat under his hand utterly
looking as if it were carved or
to detach himself lest he should
loudly for assistance without moving a
his agitation mr lorry observed
a grenadier wooden measure
into the room in
young lady by laying a
hand upon his chest and
him flying back against the nearest wall
a man was mr lorry s breathless
this figure addressing the inn servants
instead of standing there staring at me
let you know if you don
softly laid the patient on
sofa and tended her with
and my bird and spreading
shoulders with great pride and care and
look at her with
lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted
a question so hard
on at a distance
woman having banished the inn servants
the mysterious penalty of
them know something not mentioned if they
there staring recovered her charge by a
shoulder i hope she will
feeble sympathy and humility
another question hard to answer mr
lorry withdrew to consider it v
wine had been dropped and
had happened in getting it out
a cart the cask had
of the wine shop shattered like
suspended their business or their idleness
run to the spot
one might have thought expressly to lame
living creatures that approached them had
down made scoops of
two hands joined and sipped or tried

all run out between their
others men and women
in the puddles with little mugs
mutilated earthenware or even
high windows darted here and there to
away in new directions
devoted themselves to the
and even champing the
along with it that
in such a miraculous presence a
children resounded in the
was little roughness in the sport and
playfulness there was a special companionship in
an observable inclination on the part of
which led especially among the luckier or
and the places where it had
the women who had left on a
to soften the pain in
own starved fingers and
moved away to descend again
a gloom gathered on the
that appeared more natural
suburb of saint antoine in paris
the billets and the
of the woman who
her baby was stained
wound about her head again
who had been greedy with the staves
a nightcap than in it
dipped in muddy wine lees
the time was to come when
that the cloud settled
saint antoine which a momentary gleam

doorway of the staircase
on the little courtyard close
my establishment but now that
remember one of you has already been
adieu they paid for
eyes of monsieur defarge were studying his
and quietly stepped with him
almost at the first word
defarge started and became deeply attentive it
not lasted a minute when he
jarvis lorry and miss manette emerging
the wine shop thus joined
defarge in the doorway to which
and was the general public entrance to
gloomy tile paved entry to the gloomy
any openness of aspect left but
stern voice to mr lorry
the latter whispered alone god

heavier and heavier as he and
higher such a staircase
enough now but at that time
unhardened senses every little habitation
the great foul nest of one high
rooms within every door
opened on the general staircase left

combined made it almost insupportable through such
became greater every instant mr
lorry twice stopped to
each of these stoppages was made
and all spoilt and sickly vapours
bars tastes rather than glimpses
dame had any promise on it
healthy life or wholesome
third time there was
an upper staircase of a steeper inclination
keeper of the wine shop always
a little in advance
always going on the side
mr lorry took as
he dreaded to be asked any
by the young lady
the pockets of the coat
gentleman so retired i think
defarge whispered it closer in his ear

to pieces die come to
know not what harm if
it possible exclaimed mr lorry is
a beautiful world we live in
things are possible and not only
long live the devil let us
so very low a
trembled under such strong emotion and her
expressed such deep anxiety and
that mr lorry felt it incumbent on
passing the room door and the worst
you bring to him all the
all the happiness you
well friend defarge come now business business
went up slowly and softly the
was short and they were soon
the top there as it
at the side of
door and who were intently
of one name who
forgot them in the surprise
the three glided by and
shop going straight to this one
i think it is well
are the few how do you
you are english that is another thing
there if you please a
them back he stooped and looked in
the crevice in the
there with the same
he drew the key across it three
four times before he put it clumsily
the lock and turned it as heavily
he could the door slowly opened
on either side he looked back over
and held her for he felt that
business business he urged with a
that was not of business
him of my father rendered in a
shook upon his shoulder lifted
a little and hurried
within the door and held her
inside took out the key
finally he walked across the room
depository for firewood and the like
dormer shape was in
little crane over it for
one half of this
was fast closed and the other was
in such obscurity yet work
window where the keeper of
wine shop stood looking at him
shoes vi the shoemaker good day
monsieur defarge looking down at the
good day you are still hard at

and dreadful it was not the faintness
physical weakness though confinement and
like a once beautiful colour faded away
wandering in a wilderness would have
had looked up again not with any
beforehand that the spot where
only visitor they were aware of
defarge who had not
his gaze from the shoemaker
let in a little more light
side of him then similarly
the floor on the
side of him then
say you can bear a little more
i must bear it if
let it in laying the palest shadow
word the opened half door was
and showed the workman with an
shoe upon his lap pausing in
a white beard raggedly
but not very long a hollow face
eyebrows and his confused white hair though
naturally large and looked unnaturally
at the throat and
of clothes had in a long seclusion
to such a dull uniformity
had put up a hand
his eyes and the light and
vacant gaze pausing in his work he
him without first looking down on this
without first wandering in this
finish that pair of shoes
day asked defarge motioning to mr
pair of shoes to day i
t say that i mean to
suppose so i don t know
the door when he had stood
up he showed no surprise at seeing
figure but the unsteady fingers
hand dropped to his work and he
an instant you have a visitor
see said monsieur defarge
the shoemaker looked up
his work come said defarge here
monsieur who knows a well made shoe
he sees one show
monsieur mr lorry took it in
hand tell monsieur what
usual before the shoemaker replied i
he laid the knuckles of the right
in the hollow of the right and
the task of recalling
from the vagrancy into which he
sank when he had
was like recalling some very
hope of some disclosure
my name assuredly i did one hundred
to work again until
silence was again broken you are not
turned to defarge as if he
that quarter they turned back on the
am not a shoemaker by trade no
i learnt it here i
and resumed in the manner of a
a subject of last night i asked
to teach myself and i
do you remember nothing of me
shoe dropped to the ground and he
manette mr lorry laid his hand upon
s arm do you
old time rising in your mind monsieur
looking fixedly by turns at mr lorry
gradually forced themselves through
black mist that had fallen
been there and so exactly
the expression repeated on the fair young
of her who had crept along the
see him and where she now
looking at him with hands which
towards him trembling with eagerness to
expression repeated though in stronger
on her fair young face that
like a moving light from him to
sought the ground and
about him in the
way finally with a deep long sigh
him monsieur asked defarge in a
yes for a moment
so well hush let us
the garret very near to
put out its hand and touched
lay on that side of him
and was stooping to work again
face the two spectators
of her hand she
her with the knife though they had
from them by degrees in the pauses
with the tears streaming
him then clasped them
laid his ruined head there
are not the gaoler s
you not yet trusting the
but she laid her hand upon his
a strange thrill struck him when
did so and visibly passed
sat staring at her her golden
which she wore in long curls had
and with another deep
shoemaking but not for long
his shoulder after looking doubtfully at
two or three times
work put his hand to his neck
with a scrap of
than one or two
his finger he took her hair
his hand again and looked closely at
it is the same
that it was in hers too he
her head upon my shoulder that night
and when i was brought to
north tower they found
upon my sleeve you will
me them they can
for it they came
with a frightful suddenness but she
only said in a
exclaimed whose voice was that
uttered this cry and went up
packet and tried to secure it in
the prisoner is these are
the hands she knew this is
the face she knew this is not
and manner his daughter
appealing hands upon his breast
sir at another time

hard history but i cannot tell

which warmed and lighted it

and lain awake and wept all night
the love of my poor mother
me good gentlemen thank god i
and his sobs strike against
heart o see thank god for
her arms and his face dropped on
suffering which had gone before
long undisturbed and his heaving breast
to humanity of the rest and silence
and lay there in a
upon her arm and her hair drooping
without disturbing him she said raising
from the very door
could be taken away
to remain in this city so dreadful
who was kneeling to look
then be so kind
afraid to leave him with me now
take care of him
you return and then we will remove
defarge were rather disinclined to
one of them remaining
and horses to be seen to
the day was drawing
then as the darkness closed in the
laid her head down on
hard ground close at
darkness deepened and deepened
all ready for the journey and
shoemaker s bench there was nothing
of his mind in the scared
wonder of his face whether
knew that he was free were questions
tried speaking to him but he
in him before yet he had some
voice and invariably turned to it
ate and drank what
drink and put on the
monsieur defarge going first with the lamp
lorry closing the little
they had not traversed many
remember no i don t remember it
no recollection whatever of
having been brought from his prison to
house was apparent to them they
him mutter one hundred and
looked about him it
was for the strong fortress
his head again no crowd was
the door no people
discernible at any of the many windows
reigned there only one
would get them and
against the door post knitting
saw nothing defarge got
over swinging lamps under
over swinging lamps swinging ever
in the better streets and
house there your papers travellers see here
monsieur the officer said defarge getting
and taking him gravely apart
the white head they were consigned to
with him at the he dropped his
there was a flutter among
them being handed into
coach by an arm in

upon the prisoner have
i have when i was
afterwards and at calais the

midnight in the dead of the night

shore to shore miss manette the young
before and were now turned again stood
where she had sat

am the plaintive tone of her
merged into the less musical voice

no remark upon them
passage across the channel yes
came on board do you mean the
inquired the judge knitting his brows
as he stood beside her was
fatigued and in a
father was so reduced that
of the air and
had made a bed for
at his side to take
of him there were no other
that night but we four
how the wind would set
we were out of the harbour
state and i am sure
felt it that was
how many were with him two french
until the last moment when
to be landed in
boat had any papers been
handed about among them but i don
know what papers like these in
don t know although they stood whispering
near to me because
was a dull lamp and
which arose out of my
situation as he was kind and
into tears i may
evidence which it is your duty
a delicate and difficult nature which might
said that this business had within a
forwards between france and england
anything about america miss
how that quarrel had arisen
judge it was a wrong and
one on england s part he added

saying this it was said
part of a chief actor
to whom many eyes are directed

write it down watched

among the lookers on there
the same expression in all quarters of
majority of the foreheads
might have been mirrors reflecting the witness
the judge looked up from
about george washington mr
call the young lady s father
doctor manette look upon the
have you ever seen him before
when he called at
lodgings in london some three years or
or speak to his conversation with your
sir i can do neither is
has it been your
to undergo a long imprisonment without trial
manette he answered in a tone that
the occasion in question they tell
so have you no remembrance
the occasion none my mind is a
from some time i cannot even
my captivity in making
she had become familiar to me
a gracious god restored my
i have no remembrance of
father and daughter sat down together
the prisoner went down with
information a witness was
in the coffee room of an hotel
that garrison and dockyard town waiting
was cross examining this
had never seen the
gentleman who had all this time
it up and tossed it to
in the next pause the counsel
with great attention and curiosity at
prisoner you say again you
quite sure that it was the prisoner
so like the witness said
look well upon that
and then look well upon
my learned friend s appearance being careless
each other to surprise not only
witness but everybody present when they
thus brought into comparison my lord
counsel whether they were next to
mr carton name of my learned friend
to my lord no but
would ask the witness
twice whether he would have been
confident if he had seen this illustration
more the upshot of
was to smash this witness like a
of the evidence he had now
attend while mr stryver fitted the
in blood and one of the
like how the virtuous
swearers had rested on the
in france he being of
those affairs were a consideration
others who were near and dear
life to disclose how
evidence that had been warped and wrested
they had witnessed came to nothing
the mere little innocent gallantries and
was altogether too extravagant and impossible to
as a monstrous joke how it
be a weakness in
government to break down
and fears and therefore mr
general had made the most
it how nevertheless it
disfiguring such cases and of which
state trials of this country were
true saying that he could
sit upon that bench
few witnesses and mr cruncher had
the whole suit of clothes

something especially reckless in his demeanour not
diminished the strong resemblance
earnestness when they were compared together had
that many of the lookers
said to one another
alike mr cruncher made the observation to
get no law work to
manette s head dropped upon her father
see it and to say audibly
look to that young lady
the gentleman to take
her father it had evidently
a great distress to him
had shown strong internal
when he was questioned
that pondering or brooding
which made him old had been upon

some surprise that they were not agreed
should retire under watch
ward and retired himself the trial had

the court carried him along

he was clear of the
bailey for the crowd came pouring out
there all day was straining off
stood gathered round mr
darnay just released congratulating him on
by a far brighter
to recognise in doctor manette
low grave voice and to
abstraction that overclouded him fitfully without
long lingering agony would always
as incomprehensible to those unacquainted
his story as if they
seen the shadow of the
bastille thrown upon him by
summer sun when the substance was
that united him to
beyond his misery and the sound of
voice the light of her
almost always not absolutely
for she could recall some occasions on
few and slight and
still had his wig and gown
his late client to that degree
the less likely to succeed
best is as good
one to say much

doctor manette to break up this conference

an intent look deepening
this strange expression on
his thoughts had wandered away
the shadow off and
yes the friends of the acquitted prisoner
not be released that night
lights were nearly all
place was deserted until
darnay lucie manette passed into the open
a word with any one
them but who had been leaning
the wall where its
was darkest had silently
and mr darnay stood upon the
had made any acknowledgment of mr
it he was unrobed
appearance if you knew what
natured impulse and business appearances you would

which was a large one as
to forget that i belong to
i for it so we
not much alike in any
like a dream charles
was at a loss how
dinner is done carton presently said
you give your toast what health what
tip of your tongue it
to be it must be i ll
then looking his companion
where it shivered to pieces
rang the bell and ordered
hand to a coach
and a laconic yes
fair young lady to be pitied
of such sympathy and
that she showed she was
of the day he turned
it i neither want any
rejoinder it was nothing to do
in the second mr darnay let
ask you a question willingly and a
return for your good offices do you

have a very good opinion of
parting without ill blood
either side carton rejoining
wine drawer and come and wake
charles darnay rose and wished him good
without returning the wish carton rose
of defiance in his
and said a last word
darnay you think i am drunk

drudge sir i care for
man on earth and no
your talents better may be so mr

glass that hung against
that ah confound you
a good reason for
what you have fallen away from and
places with him and would you have
he was come on and have it
he resorted to his pint of wine
few minutes and fell asleep on his
with his hair straggling over
the jackal those were drinking days
wine and punch which
neither was mr stryver already
lucrative practice behind his
which he mounted sessions and old
had now to summon
favourite specially to their longing arms
shouldering itself towards the visage of
lord chief justice in the court of
s bench the florid
a great sunflower pushing
the advocate s accomplishments but a
improvement came upon him as to
the more business he got the
fingers ends in the
sydney carton idlest and
his hands in his pockets staring
they prolonged their usual orgies
into the night and carton was
to be seen at broad day
that although sydney carton would never

humble capacity ten o clock
do you mean ten o
honour told me to
you oh i remember
well very well after a few dull
of king s bench walk and paper
conferences had gone home and the
principal opened the door he
that rather wild strained seared marking about

room lined with books
upon the hob and
the midst of the
of papers a table
with plenty of wine upon it
brandy and rum and sugar and
you have had your

i think i have been dining
rare point sydney that you brought to
upon the identification how did you
same sort of fellow if i had
any luck mr stryver laughed till he
his dress went into
with a large jug of
water a basin and a
or two steeping the towels in
he folded them on his
sat down at the
not much boiling down to be
stryver gaily as he looked
his papers how much
two sets of them give me
on one side of the drinking table
bestrewn table proper on
other side of it with the bottles
lion for the most
reclining with his hands
his waistband looking at the
jackal with knitted brows and intent
did not even follow the
he stretched out for
glass which often groped about
a minute or more
two or three times the matter in
became so knotty that the
to get up and steep his towels
words can describe which were
the more ludicrous by his anxious gravity
together a compact repast for the
with care and caution made his
from it and his remarks upon it
the jackal assisted both
his waistband again and lay down
his head and applied himself to the
the lion in the same manner
punch said mr stryver the jackal removed
always am sound am
the jackal again complied the
as he reviewed him
the next now in spirits
sighing yes the same sydney
the same luck even
the fire grate had been the furnace
was to shoulder him
it your way is and always was
moral how have i done what i
i do partly through paying me
air about it what you
were always in the front rank and
into the front rank
was not present at
were said carton at

my soul i am
sure that it was not yours
were always driving and riving
past with the day breaking turn me
some other direction before
pretty witness said stryver
i have had enough
picturesque doctor s daughter miss manette
pretty is she not
the admiration of the
said mr stryver looking
him with sharp eyes and slowly
a hand across his
you sympathised with the
haired doll and were quick to see
see what happened if a girl doll
no doll swoons within a
you but i deny the beauty
now i ll have
more drink i ll get
day was coldly looking in through
the house the air
the river dark and dim the whole
the city waste forces within him
and saw for a moment lying
ambition self denial and perseverance
looked upon him gardens in which the
of life hung ripening
a well of houses he threw himself
in his clothes on a
wet with wasted tears
sadly the sun rose it
incapable of their directed
own happiness sensible of the blight
him away vi hundreds of people the
on the afternoon of a certain
to sea mr jarvis lorry
lived on his way to dine
be with them as the family
talking reading looking out of window and
getting through the day thirdly because
happened to have his own little
doubts to solve and
how the ways of the doctor
household pointed to that time as a
time for solving them a quainter corner
the corner where the doctor lived was
there was no way through it and
s lodgings commanded a pleasant
few buildings then north of
into the parish like stray
the summer light struck into the corner
in the earlier part
shadow though not in shadow so remote
that you could see beyond
staid but cheerful a wonderful place
echoes and a very harbour
the raging streets there
occupied two floors of a
a courtyard where a plane
rustled its green leaves church organs claimed
beaten by some mysterious giant
and menaced a similar conversion of all
a lonely lodger rumoured to live up
maker asserted to have a counting house
a stray workman putting his
were only the exceptions required to
before it had their own way from
morning unto saturday night doctor manette
its revival in the
into moderate request and he earned as
on the fine sunday afternoon doctor
home possibly at home but
intentions of miss pross as to
the doctor s daughter had known
by so many little
of no value but for their
rooms from the largest object
him the very chairs
tables seemed to ask him with something
that peculiar expression which he knew so
by this time whether he
there were three rooms on a
and the doors by
lorry smilingly observant of that
resemblance which he detected all
birds and flowers and books
desk and work table
used also as the dining room the
changingly speckled by the rustle of
plane tree in the yard was
doctor s bedroom and
stood on the fifth floor of
dismal house by the wine shop
the suburb of saint antoine in paris
wonder at that was the abrupt
that made him start it proceeded
miss pross the wild red
thought said miss pross
do you do inquired that
if to express that
am pretty well i thank you
mr lorry with meekness how
you nothing to boast of
miss pross indeed ah
much put out about my ladybird indeed
gracious sake say something else besides
from stature was shortness really then
ask the cause i
miss pross do dozens come for
since that whenever her original proposition
questioned she exaggerated it dear
safest remark he could think
i have lived with the darling or
darling has lived with me
your affidavit if i could have
to keep either myself or
hard mr lorry shook his head using
least degree worthy of the
to life oh if that was
say when you began it
was hard enough not that
have any fault to
with doctor manette except that he
not worthy of such a daughter which
no imputation on him
it was not to be
but it really is
miss pross to be very jealous
of those unselfish creatures found
accomplishments that they were never fortunate enough
knew enough of the world to know
than the faithful service of
by his own mind we all
said miss pross and that was my
in life here again mr
s inquiries into miss pross
brother solomon was a heartless scoundrel
poverty for evermore with no touch of
belief in solomon deducting a
trifle for this slight
mr lorry and had its weight in
good opinion of her as we
and are both people
room and had sat down there in
yet keeps that bench and
tools beside him ah returned
it within himself do
lorry had begun when miss pross
i stand corrected do you
you suppose mr lorry went on
a laughing twinkle in
bright eye as it looked kindly at
that doctor manette has any theory
he has now don t be angry
adjective away mr lorry replied
no no surely not to return
business is it not
that doctor manette unquestionably
are all well assured he
should never touch upon that question i
years ago and we are now intimate
attached and who is
miss pross i don
approach the topic with you
subject afraid it s plain enough
should think why he may be it
not knowing how he lost
or how he recovered himself
losing himself again that
remark than mr lorry had looked for
a doubt lurks in my mind
pross whether it is good for
within him indeed it is this
me that has led me
head touch that string
leave it alone like
the dead of the night and will
down in his old prison she hurries
him and they go on together
down until he is composed but he
of his restlessness to
to hint at it to him
till her love and company have
pross s denial of her own
being monotonously haunted by one
mentioned as a wonderful corner for
it had begun to echo
resoundingly to the tread of coming
very mention of that weary pacing to
break up the conference
mr lorry stood at the open
daughter whose steps he heard he
they would never approach not
would the echoes die away as
be heard in their stead
and daughter did at last appear and
albeit wild and red and grim
came up stairs and touching it up
the ends of her handkerchief and blowing
dust off it and folding
as she could possibly have
in her own hair
she had been the vainest
her and thanking her and
against her taking so much
how she spoilt lucie in
his bachelor stars for having lighted
in his declining years to a
vain for the fulfilment
still no hundreds of
in the arrangements of the little household
pross took charge of the
modest quality were so well
and so well served and so
and half french that nothing could be
miss pross s friendship being
search of impoverished french who tempted by
formed the staff of domestics regarded
for a fowl a rabbit a vegetable
anything she pleased on sundays miss pross
at unknown periods either in the
regions or in her
gained admittance on this occasion
dinner was very pleasant
it was an oppressive day and
dinner lucie proposed that the wine
they should sit there
and revolved about her they went
special benefit of mr
while they sat under
mysterious backs and ends of
the plane tree whispered to
plane tree but he
fit of the jerks the doctor
in his best condition and looked
young the resemblance between him
she leaning on his
and he resting his
on the back of
chair it was very agreeable
and with unusual vivacity
doctor manette said mr darnay
the topic in hand
have you seen much of the
lucie and i have been there but
said darnay with a smile though reddening
little angrily in another
much of it they told
what was that lucie asked
an old dungeon which had been for
years built up and forgotten every
upon a corner stone in an angle
gone to execution had cut
his last work three letters they
and hurriedly with an unsteady hand
first they were read
record or legend of
prisoner with those initials and
was suggested that the letters were
fragment of paving were found the
of a paper mingled
the ashes of a small leathern
go in he recovered himself
in large drops and he showed
it but he said not a single
as they went into the house the
as it turned towards
darnay the same singular
that had been upon it when
business eye the arm of the
than he was when
and miss pross making
jerks upon her and yet no
of people mr carton had lounged
windows open they were
by heat when the tea table was
of the windows and looked out
few said doctor manette
spoke low as people watching
waiting mostly do as people
a dark room watching and
speeding away to get
for echoes resounded with
yet a solitude said darnay when they
sometimes i have sat
even the shade of a foolish fancy
are not to be communicated i have
to be the echoes of all
our lives there is a great
be so sydney carton
footsteps were incessant and the hurry of
echoed and re echoed with the
stopping altogether all in the
a foolish fancy but you
for it when i have
i take them into mine said
lightning he added the last words after
him lounging in the window and i
them he added again
and roar of rain that he typified
it stopped him for no voice could
that sweep of water and there
at midnight the great bell of
the cleared air when mr lorry
by jerry high booted and bearing a

to look at the assemblage a second

in his seat and was just being
away with the air

unchanged front except as
the spots on his nose
would ride over any of

his fellows stooped to look

traveller monseigneur the man may the

the little crowd but

how then what is it

people he cannot pay something he
paid all monseigneur he is

heaps of poor grass again
she looked an old woman but was
knotted hands together with wild energy and
caressingly as if it

her away from the
the carriage had broken
left far behind and monseigneur again
league or two of distance that remained
sweet scents of the summer night
ragged and toil worn group
enlarged upon his man like
spectre as long as they could bear
by degrees as they could bear no
and lights twinkled in little casements which
into the sky instead of having been
house and of many
hanging trees was upon monsieur
marquis by that time
the shadow was exchanged for the light
a flambeau as his
and two stone sweeps of staircase
balustrades and stone urns and stone flowers
stone faces of men
stone heads of lions in all
as if the gorgon s head
went from his carriage sufficiently
the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance
an owl in the roof of
the other flambeau held at the
door burnt as if they
save the failing of a

of those dark nights that hold
and then heave a long low
door clanged behind him and monsieur
marquis crossed a hall grim with
weight when his lord was
and made fast for
of three rooms his bed
in a luxurious age
country the fashion of the last louis
fourteenth louis was conspicuous in their
that were illustrations of
pages in the history
france a supper table was laid for
the dark night only showed in
at the supper preparation
said he was not
been expected with monseigneur
it is not probable
i shall be ready in
and sat down alone
had taken his soup and
raising his glass of bordeaux to
lips when he put it down what
nothing the trees and the night are
looked out into the
darkness and stood with
blank behind him looking round for instructions
said the imperturbable master
too and the marquis
on with his supper he
half way through it when he again
came on briskly and came up
nephew of monseigneur he had been some
afternoon he had diminished
distance rapidly but not so rapidly
to come up with monseigneur on
him he was to be
said monseigneur that supper awaited him
and there and that
was prayed to come to it in
hands you left paris yesterday sir
said to monseigneur as he took his
me i mean not
time intending the journey i have
his answer various business without doubt said
present no other words
and they were alone
meeting the eyes of the face that
like a fine mask opened
that took me away it carried me
great and unexpected peril but it
a sacred object and if
had carried me to
i hope it would have sustained me
i doubt sir returned the nephew
marks in the nose
know you may have
the suspicious circumstances that
may be resumed the nephew glancing at
with deep distrust i know that your
uncle with a fine pulsation
it thank you said the
air almost like the tone of a
quite understand returned the uncle sipping
coffee dare i ask you to
i believe that if
me to some fortress indefinitely it
even resolve to incommode you
perceive that happily for
the reception of the day before
was as usual a
not say happily my friend
the uncle with refined
for consideration surrounded by the advantages of

these gentle aids to
france in all such things is changed
over the surrounding vulgar from this
our station in these

could becomingly be of a
old time and in the
believe our name to be more detested
any name in france

of the low there is not pursued
nephew in his former tone a
i can look at
all this country round about us which

slavery a compliment said
family merited by the
grandeur hah and he
another gentle little pinch of snuff and
his eyes thoughtfully and
at him sideways with a stronger
philosophy the dark deference of fear and
dogs obedient to the whip as long

be a very few years hence and
too were to be a

he might have been at a
fire charred plunder wrecked rains as

it is scarcely worth mentioning
claim it yet if it passed
me from you to morrow
not probable or twenty years hence
elsewhere it is little to relinquish what
here but seen in its
crumbling tower of waste mismanagement extortion debt

down so that the miserable
who cannot leave it and

the last point of endurance may
another generation suffer less but

pleasure of seeing you

he rang his little
again and summoned his valet
and gone monsieur the marquis
to and fro in his
chamber robe to prepare himself gently for
about the room his
on the floor he

people of the village were at the

tethered to anything that
nothing particularly repaying their

interrupted saunter some of the people of
chateau and some of
of the posting house
all the taxing authorities were armed more
less and were crowded
the other side of the
street in a purposeless way that
highly fraught with nothing
a group of fifty
the breast with his blue
servant on horseback and the conveying away
gallop like a new version of the
which it had waited
about two hundred years it
two promises more months to the
of twelve had come
gone and mr charles darnay
teacher of the french
literature in this age he would
been a professor in that age
who could find any leisure
and he cultivated a taste for its
of knowledge and fancy he
sound english and render them into
english such masters were not
that time easily found princes
to be were not yet
ruined nobility had dropped out of tellson
ledgers to turn cooks
student s way unusually pleasant and
and as an elegant
darnay soon became known and
perseverance and untiring industry he
in london he had expected neither to
on pavements of gold
such exalted expectation he would not have
he had expected labour and he
as a sort of tolerated smuggler who
a contraband trade in european
instead of conveying greek and latin
his time he passed in london now
eden to these days when
is mostly winter in
gone one way charles
the love of a woman he had
of his danger he had never
a sound so sweet and
as the sound of her compassionate voice
so tenderly beautiful as hers
dug for him but he had
long long dusty roads the solid stone
of a dream had been done
yet by so much as
her the state of
this he knew full well
in london from his college
recovered energy he was
a little fitful and sudden as he
other recovered faculties but this had never
frequently observable and had
more and more rare he
sight of whom he laid
and sydney carton were
in the matter he
is well said the doctor as
soon be home doctor manette
there was a blank silence
said the doctor with evident constraint
your chair here and speak on he
as to the chair but appeared
began for some year and
half that i hope the
it so a little while he said
it back is lucie
hard for me to speak of her
that tone of yours charles darnay it
a tone of fervent admiration
it i do you justice i
that charles darnay hesitated shall i go
sir another blank yes go
you anticipate what i
say though you cannot know how
feel it without knowing my secret
loved yourself let your old love speak
me the doctor sat with his face
the ground at the last
he stretched out his
again hurriedly and cried not that sir
that be i adjure you
was so like a cry of actual
that it rang in charles darnay
seemed to be an appeal to
to pause the latter so received it
remained silent i ask your pardon
doubt your loving lucie you may
in his chair but
his chin dropped upon his hand and
spoken to lucie no nor written
not to know that your
father her father thanks you
offered his hand but his
said darnay respectfully how can
i who have seen you together
so touching so belonging
that mingled with the affection
duty of a daughter
itself i know that as in
now devoted to you with all the
and fervour of her present
days in which you were
to her i know perfectly well that
could hardly be invested in her
with a more sacred character than that
know that when she
i know that in loving you she
loves her mother broken
known this night and day since
his face bent down his
with this hallowed light about you i
as it was in the nature
felt and do even
feel that to bring my love even
so good as itself but i
her heaven is my witness that
love her i believe it answered her
darnay upon whose ear
reproachful sound that if my fortune
so cast as that
one day so happy as to make
any separation between her and you
i now say besides that i
it ever could be
as he spoke no dear doctor
like you a voluntary exile from
striving to live away from it by
happier future i look only to
your fortunes sharing your life and
and being faithful to you to the
not to divide with
but to come in aid of it
bind her closer to you
such a thing can be his touch
lingered on her father s hand answering
touch for a moment but not
her father rested his hands
to dark doubt and dread you
so feelingly and so
my heart or nearly
the hopefulness to do it for
have that hopefulness to morrow do
have thought it possible that you
if you should deem it
you seek any promise
i well understand that without you i
held me at this moment in
have the presumption to assume so
i could retain no place in
if that be so do
involved in it i understand equally well
a word from her father in
save my life i am
arise out of close
as well as out
in this one respect such a
i ask sir if
think she is as he hesitated her
to say her father considered a little
here too occasionally if it be at
it can only be by one
these or both said darnay i
think either likely you want
promise from me tell
part such a confidence as i
have said and to your belief
to urge no influence against
in this this is
i ask the condition
which i ask it
which you have an undoubted right to
believe your object to be
and truthfully as you have stated
i believe your intention
the ties between me and
essential to her perfect happiness i
give her to you if
were charles darnay if there were the
hands were joined as the doctor spoke
head they should all
obliterated for her sake she
everything to me more to
to me well this
and so strange his
look when he had ceased to speak
cold in the hand that
it you said to me
was at a loss
to answer until he remembered having
answered your confidence in
confidence on my part
present name though but slightly changed from
my own i wish
tell you what that is and why
from you stop for an instant the
two hands laid on
shall tell me on your marriage
do you promise willingly give me
it is better she should not
us together to night go god
hour later and darker when lucie
home she hurried into
had gone straight up stairs
was surprised to find his
a low hammering sound in his
passing lightly across the intermediate
she looked in at his door and
her blood all chilled what
i do what shall
and softly called to him
noise ceased at the
to her and they
up and down together for a
time she came down
sleep that night he slept heavily
old unfinished work were all as usual
on that self same night or
double tides that night and the night
and the night before that and a
many nights in succession making a grand
should come with its fogs atmospheric
mill again sydney was none the
and none the soberer for so
application it had taken a
condition as he now pulled his
off and threw it into the basin
hours are you mixing

the portly with his hands in his
he lay on his back

marry do you yes and not

sydney i rather despair
such an insensible dog and
returned sydney busy concocting the punch
rejoined stryver laughing boastfully though i don
i know better still
mean i am a
of more more say gallantry
who cares more to be
knows better how to be agreeable in
woman s society than you do
on said sydney carton no
head in his bullying
ve been at doctor
s house as much as

life and soul i have
ashamed of you sydney
should be very beneficial to a
ought to be much obliged to me
that way rejoined stryver
the rejoinder at him
sydney it s my duty to
you and i tell you to your
to do you good that you are
devilish ill conditioned fellow in
sort of society you are
disagreeable fellow sydney drank a bumper
look at me said stryver squaring himself
have less need to make
independent in circumstances why do i
carton with a careless air i
you would keep to
you have no business to be
was his friend s answer
announcement of the name make you uncomfortable
friendliness for the disclosure he
t mean half you say and if
meant it all it
this little preface because you once mentioned
young lady to me in slighting terms
sydney carton looked at his punch
looked at his complacent friend drank
punch and looked at his complacent friend
feeling in that kind of way
of your employing such a designation but
therefore i am no more annoyed
who had no eye for pictures or
about it syd said
of some distinction it is
are you astonished carton still drinking
you approve carton still drinking the punch
chum is a man of a
have had enough of
style of life with no
a home when he feels
he doesn t he
miss manette will tell
do me credit so i have made
word to you about your
you are in a bad way you
the value of money you live
really ought to think about
which he said it
you pursued stryver to look it
in the face you in your
way marry provide somebody to take care
find out some respectable woman
a little property somebody in the
marry her against a rainy
to that magnanimous bestowal of
before he left town for the long
done with and they could then
at their leisure whether he should
her his hand a week or
before michaelmas term or
way to the verdict argued with
jury on substantial worldly grounds the only
he called himself for the plaintiff
inaugurated the long vacation with a formal
unaccountably failing too it behoved him to
himself in soho and there declare his
way from the temple while
bloom of the long vacation
soho while he was
on saint dunstan s side of
jostlement of all weaker people might
seen how safe and strong he was
he both banking at tellson s and
of the manettes it entered
reveal to mr lorry the brightness
the soho horizon so he pushed
past the two ancient cashiers
books ruled for figures with perpendicular
ruled for figures too and everything under
clouds were a sum halloa said
tellson s that old clerks
distant corners looked up
looks of remonstrance as though
squeezed them against the wall
in the far off perspective lowered displeased
if the stryver head had been
said in a sample tone of
voice he would recommend
the circumstances how do you
mr stryver how do
when the house pervaded
air he shook in a self
way as one who shook for tellson
character why no thank
strayed to the house afar off
am going said mr stryver leaning
it was a large double one
appeared to be not half
an offer of myself in marriage to
chin and looking at his
dubiously oh dear me sir repeated
drawing back oh dear
sir what may your meaning be mr
my meaning answered the man of business
of course friendly and appreciative and
it does you the greatest credit

add internally you know there really
so much too much of you
said stryver slapping the
i ll be hanged mr
both ears as a means towards that
eligible you are eligible am

lorry delighted to be able to
crestfallen well i were you
i wouldn t if i

a forefinger at him

have a reason state
reason why wouldn t
but this beats everything mr lorry glanced
angry stryver here s a man of
complete success he says
s no reason at all
remarkable if he had said it with
with the young lady and when
causes and reasons that will tell
such with the young lady the
goes before all then you mean
tell me mr lorry said stryver squaring
present in question is a
fool not exactly so i mean
tell you mr stryver said mr
reddening that i will
no disrespectful word of that young
from any lips and that if i
and whose temper was so overbearing
from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady
this desk not even
of being angry in a suppressed tone
was his turn that is
i mean to tell you
said mr lorry pray let there
no mistake about it mr stryver
the end of a ruler
broke the awkward silence by saying this
something new to me mr lorry

saying anything about this matter for

affection for them both i have

the light within him and yet he
care something for the streets that environed

solitary figure lingering there and
strong relief removed beauties of architecture in
perhaps the quiet time

mr stryver after notifying to
city streets had some

became animated by an
up stairs and found
at her work alone she had never
seated himself near her table but
observed a change in it i fear

i have begun the question on
better life god knows it is a
then why not change it looking gently
and saddened to see that
tears in his voice too as he
i am i shall sink lower and

at her and said pray

so adorn the dearest ties
that there is a man

he said farewell said
last god bless you and left

the busy hours of the day
ever tending eastward from the sun
ever tending to the plains

several centuries been on
watching one stream saving
women mostly of a full habit

young gentleman on the ear
what do you want
me d ye hear i

then said mr cruncher i won t
his son obeyed and the crowd
a dingy hearse and
was only one mourner dressed in
position appeared by no
to please him however with
and incessantly groaning and calling
yah spies tst yaha
with many compliments too numerous and
excited when a funeral
tellson s naturally therefore a funeral with
uncommon attendance excited him greatly and
asked of the first man

immediately filled with eight

some protest against these changes in
and several voices remarking on the
the profession to reason
protest was faint and brief the
character of the time was impressed

pipe smoking song roaring and infinite caricaturing

a honest tradesman my
her head why you re
you may as well go
me one way as
to tea ah it is yes
that s about it
cruncher had no particular meaning in
them as people not unfrequently do to
jerry said mr cruncher
and seeming to help
think so i believe you
may i go with you
asked his son briskly no you mayn

that gentleman shaking his head

the evening to keeping a

evening wore away with
cruncher family until young jerry
them mr cruncher beguiled the earlier watches
did not start upon
towards that small and ghostly
locked cupboard and brought forth
sack a crowbar of convenient size a
and chain and other
light and went out young jerry who
undressing when he went to bed was
followed out into the streets he
in no uneasiness concerning his getting into
lodgers and the door stood ajar
his eyes were close to one another
honoured parent steering northward
not gone far when he was
an hour from the first starting

he might have supposed the second
of the gentle craft to have
of a sudden split himself into
the road upon the top
the bank was a low
wall the three turned out of the
the wall there risen to
crouching down in a
object that young jerry saw was the
scaling an iron gate he
soon over and then the second
got over and then the third
all dropped softly on the
a little listening perhaps
it was now young jerry s
to approach the gate which he did
creep far before they stopped
running away but lured him
peeped in at the gate
a screwing and complaining sound down below
their bent figures were strained
if by a weight
slow degrees the weight broke away
the surface young jerry very
saw it and saw
honoured parent about to
it open he was so frightened
he made off again and
it being a spectral
highly desirable to get to the

the coffin he had seen
running after him and pictured as hopping
behind him bolt upright upon its narrow

overtaking him and hopping on
his side perhaps taking his

of its coming hopping out of them
was incessantly hopping on
and gaining on him so
when the boy got
upstairs with a bump on
stair scrambled into bed with

jerry in his closet was
wrong with him at least
ears and knocking the back of
head against the head board
jerry jerry his wife implored you oppose
partners suffer you was to honour
obey why the devil don t you
poor woman protested with tears is it
it obeying your husband to
him on the wital
it s enough for
retorted mr cruncher to be the wife
occupy your female mind with calculations
obeying wife would let

there was no fish
breakfast and not much of anything else
different young jerry from him
grim pursuer his cunning was
it is not improbable that
had compeers in fleet
as they walked along
care to keep at arm s length
to have the stool well between them

to a stop on the pavement before
i thought you knowed everything
said the artless boy hem well
mr cruncher going on again and
off his hat to give

cruncher after turning it over
lively boy i believe it is something
a resurrection man when i

monsieur defarge s not unreasonable

mender of roads softly and
his finger at his nose
monsieur the marquis demands that

dwarf returned jacques two but what
neither did he confide in me
under those circumstances even i do
me with his finger standing near
that rascal my faith messieurs i

sought how many months nine ten
no matter the number said defarge
is well hidden but at last he
am again at work
when i raise my eyes

at his hips with cords that were
behind him i stand aside
soldiers and their prisoner pass for

their long shadows are on the hollow

on the evening when he

of the night and

they had the air of a
chin resting on his hand and his
three equally intent on
about his mouth and nose defarge standing
turns looking from him to

enfolded the defarges in

for our quarter there may be
business air it is necessary to register
how do they call that man

at her desk counted
small moneys that had been taken during

of money for the
time and began knotting them up
in which condition indeed as
the business and his domestic
the shop close shut and
her glance as she knotted
usual odours i am a little
eyes had never been
intent on the accounts but
my dear repeated madame nodding firmly
wrung out of his breast
is a long time it is
long time vengeance and retribution
a long time it
the rule it does
a man with lightning said defarge
long demanded madame composedly does it take
me defarge raised his head
in that too it does not
me how long it
to prepare the earthquake
but when it is ready it
is a long time on
it never retreats and
is always advancing look
and consider the lives
consider the faces of all
more and more of certainty every
you my brave wife returned
standing before her with his head a
bent and his hands
not question all this but it
lasted a long time and it is
you know well my wife it
said defarge with a half complaining
have helped it returned madame
tyrant and still i would then madame
her teeth set tied a very
knot indeed hold cried defarge reddening
little as if he felt charged
to see your victim and your
to sustain you sustain
without that when the time
let loose a tiger
a devil but wait
the time with the tiger and the
this piece of advice by striking
next noontide saw the admirable woman in
usual place in the wine shop knitting
assiduously a rose lay beside her
if she now and then glanced
the flower it was with no
were a few customers drinking or not
the other flies out
the coolest manner as if they themselves
elephants or something as
perhaps they thought as much at
that sunny summer day
figure entering at the
threw a shadow on madame defarge which
one she laid down her knitting
dress before she looked at the
out of the wine shop
day madame said the new comer good
good day age about
height about five feet nine
hair generally rather handsome
complexion dark eyes dark
long and sallow face aquiline nose but
mouthful of cool fresh water
madame complied with a polite air marvellous
had ever been so
fingers for a few moments and took
opportunity of observing the
it a pretty pattern
and nodding her head with
taste of saint antoine seemed to
drink when catching sight of that
they faltered made a pretence of
about as if for some
the spy had kept his
to detect no sign they
john thought madame checking off her work
at the stranger stay long
have children no children business seems bad
miserable people so oppressed
say madame retorted correcting him and
certainly it was i who said
but you naturally think so of course
think returned madame in a high
open without thinking all we
no the spy who was there to
of gossiping gallantry leaning his elbow
madame defarge s little counter and
sipping his cognac a
ah the poor gaspard
madame coolly and lightly
said the spy dropping
injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of
compassion and anger in this neighbourhood
the poor fellow between ourselves is
madame defarge as the keeper of
short and stared at him good
easy a smile under the stare
good day answered defarge drily i was
of chatting when you
head i know nothing of it having
it he passed behind the little counter
his wife s chair looking over that
at the person to
of them would have shot with the
business did not change his unconscious attitude
do observed defarge not
all but i hope to know
better i am so profoundly interested
its miserable inhabitants hah muttered defarge
pleasure of conversing with you monsieur
interesting associations with your name indeed
delivered to you you see
would do best to answer but always
brevity it was to you
monsieur how is he called in a
company over to england such is

we received the news of their safe
since then they have gradually
madame replied the spy she is
long ago you english
cold it seems to me oh you
i am english i perceive your tongue
returned madame and what the
is i suppose the man is
did not take the identification as
compliment but he made the best
it and turned it off with
to the end he added
gaspard ah poor gaspard it was
cruel it is a curious
that she is going to
marquis there he is mr
mother s family madame
effect upon her husband do what
would behind the little counter as
the striking of a
hand was not trustworthy the spy
any other mr barsad
and took his leave taking occasion to
departed that he looked forward
the pleasure of seeing monsieur and madame
had emerged into the outer presence
be true said defarge
a low voice looking
on the back of her chair what
returned madame lifting her eyebrows
be true if it is defarge began
sake destiny will keep her husband out
take him where he is to
and will lead him to
end that is to end him
strange now at least
herself her husband s name should be
under your hand at
moment by the side of
infernal dog s who has just left
stranger things than that will happen when

they are both here for their

him into his handsome face the
waters of captivity had worn but

assailant was not to be beheld in
she timidly laid her
on his dear breast and put up
to him as her love aspired

deserved then she withdrew her
the sunrise came and
shadows of the leaves of the plane
was shining brightly and they
the doctor s room where he was
with charles darnay they
through a gradual process of
been one of absolute bliss but for
yet lingering consideration that her brother

to take in every
that i brought you across the channel
a baby lord bless me how little
thought what i was doing how
my friend mr charles

how could you know it nonsense
well but don t cry said the
my pross by this time mr lorry
into anybody s eyes

at all from miss pross you

that i ought to

round her waist i

two formal folks of business are
not to lose the final opportunity
to hear you leave your good

passed over him like
to his daughter and took
in honour of the day the rest
a neighbouring church where no
eyes looked on charles darnay and lucie
was done some diamonds very bright and
glanced on the bride s hand which
newly released from the
and all went well and in
course the golden hair that
white locks in the paris garret
though it was not for long
from her enfolding arms take her
she is yours and her agitated hand
idle and curious and the preparations
pross were left quite alone
arm uplifted there had
much and some revulsion might have
old scared lost look that troubled
lorry and through his absent
mr lorry was reminded of defarge the
shop keeper and the starlight ride
think he whispered to miss
after anxious consideration i think we
best not speak to him just
presently then we will take
a ride into the country and dine
of tellson s he was detained two
when he came back
ascended the old staircase alone
said with a start what s
her hands what is to be told
ladybird he doesn t know
been when he had seen
inquiringly half as if he were
at being spoken to and bent
was open at the throat as
as if in some sense of
was a shoe of the old size
was lying by him and
shoe he muttered without looking
it ought to have
doctor manette look at
submissive manner without pausing in his work
know me my dear friend
again this is not
so but no persuasion would extract a
of hope that mr lorry could
seemed a faint expression of curiosity or
doubts in his mind two
at once impressed themselves on mr
from lucie the second that
he took immediate steps towards the latter
complete rest in aid of the kind
called away professionally and
or three hurried lines in
own hand represented to
been addressed to her by the same
to himself if that should
soon he kept another course in
which was to have a certain
hope of his recovery and of resort
this third course being thereby rendered practicable
lorry resolved to watch him attentively with
himself from tellson s
the first time in
pressed he became worried he abandoned
attempt on the first
and resolved merely to keep himself always
him as a silent
against the delusion into which he
fallen or was falling he remained
in his seat near the
was given him to eat and drink
worked on that first day until it
too dark to see worked
not have seen for his life to
manner and repeated in the old
me why not he made
lorry thought he saw
he leaned forward on his
himself why not the sagacity of
man of business perceived an
here and determined to
it miss pross and he divided
night into two watches and observed him
lay down but when
he was up betimes and went straight
on this second day mr lorry saluted
was evident that he
they quietly spoke of
precisely in the usual
and as if there were nothing amiss
mr lorry asked him as before dear
will you go out
with me why not this time
absent for an hour
in the meanwhile the doctor had
and mr lorry s hope
heavier every day the third
fifth five days six
and heavier mr lorry passed through this
observe that the shoemaker
on his work and that his
as in the dusk of the ninth
was startled by the shining of the
night he rubbed his eyes and roused
and tools were put aside
which mr lorry could distinctly see though
very pale was calmly studious and
a disturbed dream of
show him his friend before him in
usual and was there any sign within
range that the change of
impression had actually happened it
first confusion and astonishment the answer being
if the impression were not produced
he to have fallen asleep
his clothes on the
in doctor manette s
room and to be debating these points
early morning within a few
he had had any particle
of necessity have resolved it
he was by that
time go by until the regular
if he appeared to
mind mr lorry would then cautiously
from the opinion he
been in his anxiety so anxious to
scheme was worked out with
linen and with his usual neat
way and came to breakfast
had taken place yesterday an incidental allusion
thrown out to the
counting and evidently made him uneasy in
other respects however he was so composedly
aid was his own therefore
on a very curious case
which i am deeply interested that is
may be less so glancing at
hands which were discoloured by
attentively he had already glanced at
lorry touching him affectionately
pray give your mind to
and advise me well
daughter s my dear manette if
understand said the doctor in a subdued
some mental shock yes be explicit
the doctor spare no detail mr
and a prolonged shock
great acuteness and severity
the affections the feelings the the as
was borne down one cannot say for
time himself and there are no
he cannot trace himself as
striking manner it is the case
in a low voice asked of
the fact now did you ever see
asked the doctor distinctly and
when the relapse fell on
respects as he was then i think
has been kept from her and
and to one other
may be trusted the doctor grasped his
his hand in return
while now my dear manette
i do not possess
is no man in this world
whom i could so rely for
guidance as on you tell
about is there danger of another
about at all what can
than i am to serve mine
me on the right track i
me to see it a little
clearly and teach me how to
were spoken and mr lorry did not
shudder you have no idea how
be sensibly relieved if
could prevail upon himself to impart that
brooding to any one when
is on him i
in some cases to be quite impossible
said mr lorry gently laying
malady some intense associations of a most
think it is probable that there
occasion he tried to prepare himself
vain perhaps the effort to prepare himself
natural hesitation the doctor looked desolately
and answered in a low voice
hinted mr lorry as to the
said the doctor recovering firmness i should
soon i should have great
vaguely foreseen and contended against and
and passed i should hope
good comfort i am thankful
mr lorry i am thankful repeated the
am anxious to be instructed
may go on you cannot do your
of a studious habit and unusually energetic
applies himself with great ardour to
acquisition of professional knowledge to the conducting
experiments to many things now does
do too much i
it in part the
of affliction the less it was
with healthy things the more it would
in danger of turning in the unhealthy
he may have observed himself and made
dear manette if he were overworked now
in one direction and it
think that henceforth nothing but some extraordinary
of that chord could renew it after
any such violent sounding of that
again i trust and i almost
a thing would overset the
organisation of the mind and yet with
endurance and distress it
and encouraged than he really was
approached his second and
most difficult of all
will call blacksmith s
blacksmith s work we
say to put a case
for the sake of
forge we will say
he was unexpectedly found at his forge
on the ground he has always
would it not be better
still the doctor with
easy to advise me said
s mind he once yearned so
welcome when it came
doubt it relieved his pain so much
and by substituting as he became
practised the ingenuity of
to bear the thought of
it quite out of his reach even
old employment and not
terror like that which one may
like his illustration as he raised
eyes to mr lorry s face but
as a plodding man of business who
the idea if the thing were
companion i would not
as he saw the doctor disquieted i
recommend him to sacrifice
me your authority like a dear
my dear manette very
to see what a struggle there
i would not take it away while
lorry readily engaged for
away to join lucie and her husband
account for his silence mr lorry
on the night of the day on
mr lorry hacked the
s bench to pieces
miss pross held the candle as if
in her grimness she was
were buried in the
removal of its traces almost felt and
pair came home the first person who
or in looks or in
aside into a window
overheard mr darnay said
i wish we might be friends
are already friends i hope you are
enough to say so as
don t mean any fashion
speech indeed when i
i wish we might
i find that easier to comprehend
my own mind than to
a certain famous occasion when
a certain famous occasion when you
me to confess that you had been
i remember it too
curse of those occasions is heavy upon
into account one day when
don t be alarmed
that away on the drunken occasion
as you know i was
is not so easy
forgotten it and a
you on the faith of a gentleman
good heaven what was there to dismiss
remember in the great service you
of it in that way that
what became of you when i
it i am speaking of
past you make light of the
trust me i have gone aside from
being friends now you know me
if you doubt it ask stryver and
well at any rate you know me
t know that you
will but i do and you must
my word for it well if you
i might be permitted to come
an useless and i
add if it were
and me an unornamental
of furniture tolerated for its old service
taken no notice of i doubt if
should abuse the permission it
i should avail myself of it
know that i had it will
of saying that i
have indicated i thank you darnay i
think so carton by this
turned away within a minute afterwards
was to all outward
as unsubstantial as ever when he
of an evening passed
spoke of sydney carton
not bitterly or meaning to bear hard
who saw him as he showed himself
could dwell in the thoughts of
said darnay drawing his arm about
yes dearest charles with
we are rather thoughtful to
for we have something on our mind
to press one question on me
i promise what will
that beat for him
night indeed my own why so that
is enough what would you
me do my life
would ask you dearest to be
on his faults when he is not
are deep wounds in
my dear i have seen it bleeding
charles darnay quite astounded that i should
done him any wrong
is so i fear he is
to be reclaimed there is scarcely a
that anything in his character or
things even magnanimous things she looked
her faith in this lost man
head upon his breast and raising
he is in his
the supplication touched him home i will
will remember it as long
head and put the rosy
soft blue eyes so loving
that husband he might have cried
the night and the
doctor lived ever busily
her father and herself and
old directress and companion in a
tranquilly resounding corner listening
first there were times
she was a perfectly happy
wife when her work
her eyes would be dimmed for
audible yet that stirred
doubts hopes of a love as
delight divided her breast among the echoes
there would arise the
thoughts of the husband who would
her eyes and broke like waves that
the advancing echoes there was the
of her prattling words let greater echoes
s laugh and the divine friend
she had confided hers seemed to
sacred joy to her ever busily winding
their lives and making it
corrected snorting and pawing
sister but i am called and i
go those were not tears all of
her embrace that had
entrusted to it suffer
see my father s face o father
that breath of heaven
of the winds that blew
a hushed murmur like
breathing of a summer sea asleep upon
sandy shore as the
morning or dressing a doll at
mother s footstool chattered in
were blended in her life the echoes
answered to the actual tread
sydney carton some half dozen times
never came there heated with wine
one other thing regarding him was whispered
true echoes for ages and ages no
ever really loved a woman lost
and knew her with
strange sympathy with him an instinctive delicacy
pity for him what fine
sensibilities are touched in such a
no echoes tell but it
little lucie held out
place with her as she grew
at the last poor carton kiss him
me mr stryver shouldered
way through the law
some great engine forcing itself
turbid water and dragged
boat towed astern as the
rough plight and mostly under
him than any stimulating sense of desert
disgrace made it the life he was
emerging from his state
lion s jackal than any real jackal
be supposed to think of rising to
and had offered as
to lucie s husband delicately saying halloa
your matrimonial picnic darnay the polite
in the training of the
gentlemen by directing them to beware
the pride of beggars like that tutor
he was also in the
of his king s bench
bodied wine and the lie excused him
the latter by saying that he had
it so often that he believed
himself which is surely such an
to justify any such offender s being
these were among the echoes
which lucie sometimes pensive
until her little daughter was six
old how near to her heart
need not be told nor
directed by herself with such a
than any waste was music to
nor how there were
the many times her father
told her that he found
to divide her love for
or her help to
and asked her what
the magic secret my darling
yet never seeming to be hurried or
have too much to do but
this space of time and
nine mr lorry came
late from tellson s and sat
night at tellson s
have been so full
uneasiness in paris that we have
to us fast enough there is
us at tellson s are getting

his sweet temper was soured and that
doctor entering the dark

otherwise than safe and well here

inquiries made there were in

with him in a low
the penitential den once set apart for
the news exchange and was filled to

mr lorry glanced at the
you can have no conception

which our books and
above knows what the compromising consequences
if some of our

they might be at
least possible delay and
burying of them or
one but myself if any one and
you are to remember
at this present time no
us here i speak in strict confidence

jerry jerry has been my bodyguard
and i am used
being anything but an

at anybody who touches his master
s proposal to retire
live at my ease time enough
to think about growing old this dialogue
under his reverses as a refugee and
was much too much the
of native british orthodoxy to
of this terrible revolution as if
france and of the
and perverted resources that should have
them prosperous had not
and had not in
words recorded what they saw such
combined with the extravagant plots
state of things that had utterly
itself and worn out heaven
earth as well as
to a latent uneasiness in his mind
his devices for blowing the people up
for accomplishing many similar objects
tails of the race him
might hear no more and
approached mr lorry and laying a soiled
unopened letter before him asked if
direction the more quickly because

undertake to explain that
where to forward it and
it has been here some
come back to see you off very
the best of his way
the quiet of the temple opened

destroyed razed to the
monsieur heretofore the marquis
without your so generous help is
tell me treason against

unhappy service your afflicted gabelle the

in the temple considering what
horror of the deed which had culminated
bad deeds and bad reputation of the

his love for lucie
by no means new
his own mind had been hurried

employed the swift changes and troubles

by and the nobility were trooping from
him for it but he had oppressed

his mind drifted him on faster and
more and more steadily to

instruments and that he

and half reproaching him he

instantly followed the sneers of monseigneur which

must go to paris
the loadstone rock was drawing him and
had done what he
it incomplete presented it before him in
which is so often the
influence to guide this raging revolution that
walked to and fro with
resolution made he considered that neither lucie
her father must know
to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous
of old should come to
doubt how much of the incompleteness
of france in his mind
course he walked to and fro with
as he arrived in paris he
booted and equipped i have delivered
letter said charles darnay to mr

the message to the
gabelle in prison simply `that

with his hand upon the fastening

life in this city

pleasantly to a little
satisfaction do you go

it was put before him and he
one who really was looking
a hand at cards sheep
committees now turnkey now prisoner
spy and secret informer so
english that an englishman is
open to suspicion of subornation
represents himself to his employers under

english government is the spy of
the treacherous foe of the republic

uneasily i play my
the nearest section committee

suggested to his mind he
proofs would produce against
that fatal register and would quash
last chance of life
that all secret men are men
livid as he turned them over

to mr lorry i
appeal to a gentleman of your
and benevolence to put it

mr cruncher dwelt upon
as quite a liberal
card mr barsad impossible here in
paris with suspicion filling the air for
to outlive denunciation when you are in

the mystery about him of having feigned
the prisons of the foreigner

not detain me he had a coach
waiting it brought me here it brought
over my mouth from behind and
a single gesture the marquis took
his pocket the letter i
written showed it me burnt it in
and extinguished the ashes with his
brothers in all these
or dead i might have thought that
had not quite abandoned them
mercies and them and
the times when all these things
them to heaven and
eagerness that had nothing
in it but blood
narrative called up the most
passions of the time and there was
a head in the
in presence of that tribunal and
had not made the paper public
the other captured bastille memorials borne in
and had kept it biding their time
detested family name had long been anathematised
saint antoine and was wrought into
that place that day against
denunciation and all the worse for the
man that the denouncer
his wife one of the frenzied aspirations
public virtues of antiquity and
altar therefore when the president
republic would deserve better still of the
and would doubtless feel
daughter a widow and her
an orphan there was wild excitement patriotic
much influence around him
a notorious oppressor of the
wretched wife of the
man thus doomed to die fell
the sentence as if she had been
stricken but she uttered no sound and
him in his misery and not
it that it quickly raised
a public demonstration out
when lucie stood stretching out her
towards her husband with
in her face but love and
a gaoler left along
two of the four
proposed to the rest let
seats in the hall to a
on my love we shall meet

her god will raise up
and would have fallen on his knees
what have you done what
us we know now
a struggle you made of old
you suspected my descent and when
and conquered for her
our hearts and all our love and
answer was to draw his hands
with a shriek of
they have fallen out it
that first brought my
of such evil a happier end was
heaven bless you as he was
and with a radiant look upon her
smile as he went
laid her head lovingly on her
s breast tried to
the obscure corner from which he had
he took his seat beside the
gateway where he had
in the dark not
of the rough stones
the street her feet had trodden he
the staircase to their rooms
so don t revive her to consciousness
she only faints oh carton
springing up and throwing
arms passionately round him in a burst
something to save papa
look at her dear
people who love her bear to
the child and laid her blooming cheek
gently from him and looked at her
child who was nearest to him
handsome old lady that she heard him
gone out into the next room

they not nothing connected with charles was
strongest assurances that i should

delayed till dark i should
to know how you speed though
powers doctor manette immediately

no hope said mr lorry in a
all of these men
disposed to spare him
is a large supposition
demonstration in the court and
it don t despond said carton
gently don t grieve i
doctor manette in this idea because
she might think `his life
yes returned mr lorry drying his
you are right but he will perish
is no real hope yes
will perish there is no
hope echoed carton and walked
a settled step down stairs
to show myself i think so it
here it is a sound precaution and
be a necessary preparation but
his steps which had
to tend towards an object he took
turn or two in the already darkening
mind to its possible consequences his
these people should know there
he turned his face towards
wine shop in the saint
suburb it was not difficult for
who knew the city well to
his house without asking any question having
its situation carton came out of those
of refreshment and fell sound asleep after
little light thin wine
s hearth like a man who had
window where there was
coat collar and his wild hair this
he went on direct to defarge s
went in there happened
but jacques three of
restless fingers and the croaking voice this
stood drinking at the
wife the vengeance assisted
the conversation like a regular member of
it was he had ordered
repeated what he had already said
over it puzzling out its meaning
heard her say i
the wine and gave
his glass ah and good wine
drink to the republic defarge
added with a laugh
my faith and you
to morrow carton followed
a studious and absorbed face
were all leaning their arms on
counter close together speaking low
it is true what madame says
well well reasoned defarge
said madame magnificent croaked jacques
good doctrine my wife said defarge
contemptuously and angrily yes i have observed
face i have observed his
to be not the face of
take care of his face and
have observed my wife said defarge
of his daughter which must be
dreadful anguish to him i have
i have observed his daughter more times
one i have observed her
other days i have observed her in
she seemed to raise it
before her as if the axe
to thee pursued madame
addressing her husband if it
thou wouldst rescue this man
this glass would do it
you then jacques said madame
tyrants and oppressors i
on my register doomed to
so it is so assented
beginning of the great
home and in the
is clear and shut we read
is read through and the
is burnt out and the day
him that secret i
as i smite it now
shore and that peasant family so injured
the two evremonde brothers
that bastille paper describes is
sister s husband that unborn
was their child that brother was
brother that father was my father those
me ask him is that so
is so assented defarge
more then tell wind and fire
to stop returned madame
don t tell me
wife a repetition of
his change and asked
defarge took him to the door
lift it and strike
his way and was
swallowed up in the
hour he emerged from it to present
found the old gentleman
and had only left her for a
she had some faint hopes
he be mr lorry waited until ten
doctor manette not returning and he
longer it was arranged that he should
back to her and
waited and the clock struck twelve
doctor manette did not come
could he be they were discussing this
of hope on his prolonged absence
stairs the instant he entered
had really been to any
known as he stood
his face told them
i cannot find it said
he spoke with a helpless
on the floor where is my
i have been looking everywhere for my
and i can t
it what have they done
within them come come said he
a whimpering miserable way let
no answer he tore his hair
beat his feet upon
t torture a poor forlorn wretch he
become of us if
restore him that as
by agreement they each put a hand
his shoulder and soothed
to sit down before
embers and shed tears
if all that had happened since
dream mr lorry saw him
by this spectacle of ruin
of her final hope and
appealed to them both too
at one another with one meaning
the stipulations i am going
going to exact i have
reason a good one i
not doubt it answered
monotonously rocking itself to and fro
moaning they spoke in such a tone
they would have used if
duties fell lightly on
floor carton took it
is it asked mr lorry eagerly
moment let me speak
took another paper from it
pass out of this
face keep it for me until to
remember and i had
why not i don
know i prefer not
do so now take
up carefully with mine and
own now observe i
doubted until within this
could have such a paper it is
until recalled but it may
reason to think will be they are
danger they are in danger of denunciation
madame defarge i know it from
own lips i have overheard words
their danger to me in strong colours
since then i have
mentioned lucie s name making
and signals to prisoners it is
common one a prison
and that it will involve her life
been seen with her at that place
t look so horrified you
carton but how i
going to tell you
it will depend on
and it could depend
no better man this new
will certainly not take place
or three days afterwards more probably a
afterwards you know it is a capital
of the guillotine she and
this crime and this woman

the journey can be made your preparations

of earnestness and though he

oppression and heartless indifference smote equally without
charles darnay alone in
cell had sustained himself with no
of the narrative he had heard
had heard his condemnation he
could possibly save him that he
virtually sentenced by the millions and that
could avail him nothing nevertheless it
beloved wife fresh before
what it must bear his hold on
was strong and it was very
clenched the tighter there and when
on that hand and it yielded this

working of his heart

to seek to know

had preserved any definite remembrance of
that he had supposed it destroyed
no mention of it among the relics
which had been described to all
world he besought her though he
means she could think
with the truth that he
uniformly forgotten himself for their joint
heaven to comfort her father
the same strain but
dangerous retrospect towards which he
he might be tending to
many added sentences of
done he never thought of carton
mind was so full
once thought of him he had time
lights were put out when
lay down on his straw bed
thought he had done with this world
free and happy back in
old house in soho though it
nothing in it like the
house unaccountably released and light
heart he was with lucie
a pause of forgetfulness and
and yet there was
of oblivion and he awoke in the
morning unconscious where he was or
had happened until it
upon his mind this is
day of my death thus had
fall and now while he was
and hoped that he could meet
he had never seen the
that was to terminate his life
high it was from
ground how many steps it
where he would be stood
he would be touched whether
touching hands would be dyed red
turned whether he would be the

again countless times neither

would never hear again nine gone for
ten gone for ever eleven

with that eccentric action of
which had last perplexed him
their names to himself the worst of
final hour was three and
to and fro with his arms folded
from him without surprise the hour had
like most other hours
thankful to heaven for his recovered
possession he thought there is but another
put in the lock
turned before the door was opened or
it opened a man said
a low voice in english
has never seen me here i
kept out of his way go
in alone i wait near lose
but he spoke and it was
me he said i could not

came suddenly into his mind a
in virtue of it i stand before

entreaty addressed to you in the most
tones of the voice

the lottery of sainte guillotine
good patriot said the other
figure placed it on a litter they
brought to the door and bent
voice i know it well answered
was left alone straining
keys turned doors clashed
passed along distant passages no cry
unusual breathing more freely in a little
two sounds that he was not afraid
for he divined their meaning then began
be audible several doors were opened
in merely saying follow me
dark winter day and
with the shadows within and
some were standing some seated some
were silent and still looking fixedly
passing to embrace him as
but the man went
a very few moments after
face in which there was no vestige

a poor little seamstress who was with

a good journey i salute

of jarvis lorry as he clasps

of leafless trees the hard uneven
is under us the soft deep

us and shake us sometimes we stick
agony of our impatience is then
again among ruinous buildings solitary farms dye
of leafless trees have these men
another road is not this the same
we are pursued hush the posting

of his words has golden hair

of his giving warning and
escape we have not half enough
score a day in
word madame defarge went on my husband
to annihilation and i have
his reason for regarding

them this very day ay
letting her eyes turn to him with
dear citizeness i answer for my fellow

other in their fervent protestations that

who hurriedly replied in the affirmative seizing
occasion to add that he
and that he would be
effect the most desolate of
of madame defarge s head
having his small individual fears
his own personal safety every hour in
is over say at
antoine and we will give information against

her further views to them
moment of his death she
impeach the justice of the republic she
i will go to her
an admirable woman what an
woman exclaimed jacques three
and embraced her take
my knitting said madame defarge placing it
her lieutenant s hands
be a greater concourse
the vengeance with alacrity and
she had already turned into the
before the tumbrils arrive
and might be relied upon to arrive
and her superb moral endowments there
disfiguring hand but there was
this ruthless woman now taking
of that kind of beauty which not
animosity but to strike
troubled time would have
her up under any
was absolutely without pity if she had
it had quite gone
of her it was nothing
forefathers she saw not him
and his daughter an orphan that
insufficient punishment because they
her natural enemies and her prey and
for herself if she
which she had been engaged she would
have pitied herself nor if she
with any softer feeling than a
desire to change places with
man who sent here there such
enough in a certain weird way
a loaded pistol lying hidden
confident tread of such a character and
bare foot and bare legged on
the journey of the travelling
of its load had
had much engaged mr lorry s
to avoid overloading the
that the time occupied
be reduced to the utmost
had proposed after anxious consideration
to leave the city should leave it
road would order its horses in advance
greatly facilitate its progress during the precious
most to be dreaded seeing in this
the hope of rendering real
in that pressing emergency
pross hailed it with joy she
jerry had beheld the
start had known who it was
their arrangements to follow the
to the else deserted lodging
you think mr cruncher said miss
you think of our
here to day it
awaken suspicion my opinion
plan my dear good mr
favour miss to take notice o
fur to record in this
tremble and who spoke with an ashy
well out o this never no
will i do it never no more
am quite sure mr cruncher returned miss
you not to think it necessary to
no miss returned jerry it shall not
will i interfere with mrs cruncher
flopping never no more whatever housekeeping arrangement
to dry her eyes
best that mrs cruncher should
my poor darlings i go so
as from a pulpit and let my
be took down and
change and that wot i
mrs cruncher may be
and i hope she finds it answering
expectations forbid it proceeded
cruncher with additional solemnity additional slowness
out as anything wot i have
on my earnest wishes for
poor creeturs now forbid it
was anyways conwenient to get em
o this here dismal risk forbid it
wot i say for bid it
was mr cruncher s conclusion
the streets came nearer and nearer
we ever get back
our native land said
pross you may rely
much as i may be able to
and understand of what you have
may be sure that i
bear witness to your being thoroughly in
at this dreadful time now pray let
the vehicle and horses from coming here
thought it might be best where
pross mr cruncher was so
that he could think
no locality but temple
near indeed by the cathedral door
of men said miss pross go to
posting house straight and make that
i am doubtful said mr cruncher hesitating
shaking his head about leaving of
you see we don
know what may happen heaven knows we
take me in at the cathedral at
our going from here i feel certain
it there bless you
cruncher with an encouraging nod
two he immediately went out to
to miss pross the necessity
composing her appearance so
her watch and it was twenty
past two she had no
cold water and began laving
she could not bear to
saw a figure standing in
come to meet that water madame defarge
the doors were all
open and would suggest the flight her
act was to shut
pross had nothing beautiful about
but she too was a determined woman
am an englishwoman madame defarge looked
her scornfully but still with
of miss pross s own perception
full well that miss pross
pross knew full well
on my way yonder said madame defarge
a slight movement of her
reserve my chair and my knitting for
i am come to make
evil said miss pross and you
hold my own against them each
in her own language neither understood the
and intent to deduce
keep herself concealed from me at
moment said madame defarge good
idiomatic remarks in detail but she
she was set at naught woman
and pig like said madame
demand to see her either tell her
i demand to see
or stand out of
way of the door
nonsensical language but i
give all i have except the
i wear to know whether you suspect
advanced one step i am
hope there is for
finger on me thus miss pross
a shake of her head and a
of her eyes between every rapid sentence
miss pross who had never struck
blow in her life
her courage was of that emotional nature
it brought the irrepressible tears
she laughed you poor wretch what
this miserable fool answer the
defarge perhaps the following
miss pross s face perhaps
madame defarge that they were
disorder there has been hurried packing
who understood the request as
if they are not in
can be pursued and brought back said
you are uncertain what
do said miss pross to herself and
shall not know that
it and know that or
has stopped me i
defarge we are alone at
top of a high house
a solitary courtyard we are not likely
be heard and i pray for bodily
you are here is
a hundred thousand guineas to
the door miss pross
the waist in both her arms
struggle and to strike miss pross
the two hands of madame
buffeted and tore her
but miss pross with her head down
hands ceased to strike and felt at
encircled waist it is under my
bless heaven for it i hold
till one or other of us faints
dies madame defarge s
were at her bosom miss pross
at it struck out a flash
a crash and stood alone blinded with
stillness it passed out on
air like the soul of the
horror of her situation miss
stairs to call for fruitless help
of what she did in time to
dreadful to go in at
the bonnet and other
on out on the staircase first
taking away the key
was naturally so peculiar in appearance as
to show disfigurement like any
deep in her face and her
unsteady hands was clutched and dragged a
the door key in the river arriving
thought what if the
stopped at the gate sent to prison
took her in and took her
asked him the usual noises mr cruncher
miss pross could not hear
and she did is there
miss pross again presently again
t hear it gone deaf in an
disturbed wot can she
hark there s the roll
miss i can hear
to her nothing o
and then a great
and that stillness seems
be fixed and unchangeable never
don t hear the roll of
dreadful carts now very nigh their journey
it s my opinion that
world and indeed she
death carts rumble hollow and
imagined since imagination could
itself are fused in the one
those that have produced this
crush humanity out of shape once
under similar hammers and it will twist
and it will surely
the same fruit according to
kind six tumbrils roll along the
change these back again to
they were thou powerful
time and they shall be
to be the carriages of absolute
toilettes of flaring jezebels the churches that
of thieves the huts
who majestically works out
changed into this shape by the
of god say the seers
the enchanted in the wise
thy former aspect changeless and hopeless the
wheels of the six carts go round
seem to plough up a long
furrow among the populace in the streets
so used are the regular
of the houses to the spectacle
no people and in some the occupation
much as suspended while the
survey the faces in the tumbrils
or authorised exponent to this cart
to this and seems to tell
sat here yesterday and who there the
before of the riders in the
with a lingering interest
in silent despair again there
they cast upon the multitude
get their straying thoughts
a crazed aspect is so shattered
sings and tries to dance not one
of the people there is a
and faces are often turned up
some of them and they are
some question it would seem to be
the same question for it is always
one man in it with their
the leading curiosity is to know
and always speaks to the girl here
cries are raised against him
they move him at all it is
to a quiet smile
he shakes his hair a little
a church awaiting the coming up of
tumbrils stands the spy and prison sheep
looks into the first of them not
third which is evremonde says
back there with his hand in the

to that now crumble in
close behind the last plough as

busily knitting on one
looking about for her
therese she cries in her shrill
the sisterhood no nor will
the woman recommends ay louder vengeance much
louder yet vengeance with a little
it will hardly bring her
other women up and down to seek
lingering somewhere and yet although
questionable whether of their own
they will go far enough to
her bad fortune cries the vengeance
