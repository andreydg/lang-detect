gargery who married the
as i never saw my
or my mother and never
any likeness of either of them for
days were long before the days
photographs my first fancies
what they were like were
a square stout dark man
curly black hair from the character
the above i drew a childish conclusion
my mother was freckled and sickly
five little stone lozenges each about a
and a half long which were
in a neat row
their grave and were
to the memory of
little brothers of mine —who gave
trying to get a living exceedingly early
that universal struggle —i am
for a belief i
entertained that they had all
born on their backs with their hands
their trousers pockets and had never taken
the marsh country down by
river within as the river wound twenty
of the sea my first most vivid
broad impression of the identity
evening at such a time i
out for certain that this bleak
above were dead and buried
buried and that the dark
and mounds and gates with
cattle feeding on it
the marshes and that
that the distant savage lair from
small bundle of shivers growing afraid

voice as a man started up
among the graves at the side
the church porch keep still you

and pollards a mile or
from the church the man
looking at me for
moment turned me upside
and emptied my pockets there was
in them but a piece
bread when the church

so sudden and strong
he made it go head
heels before me and
he ate the bread
his lips what fat cheeks you ha
i believe they were fat
i was at that time undersized for
years and not strong darn me

and if i han t half
my hope that he wouldn t and
tighter to the tombstone

i would come to him at the
you dead if you don t said
he took me down

remember that young man
faltered much of that said he glancing
him over the cold wet flat
eel at the same
arms —clasping himself as if
and among the brambles
the hands of the dead people stretching
cautiously out of their
to get a twist upon his ankle
pull him in when
came to the low church wall
were numbed and stiff and then turned
him turning i set my face towards
my shoulder and saw
going on again towards the river still
picking his way with his sore
among the great stones dropped
for stepping places when the
marshes were just a long black
line then as i stopped
look after him and the
was just another horizontal
black lines intermixed on the edge
the river i could faintly make out
upright one of these was the beacon
which the sailors steered
an unhooped cask upon a pole
ugly thing when you were
were the pirate come
life and come down and going
to hook himself up again
gave me a terrible turn
thought so too i looked
could see no signs of
home without stopping chapter ii
sister mrs joe gargery was more
twenty years older than
and had established a great
with herself and the neighbors
having at that time to find out
myself what the expression meant
hand and to be much
the habit of laying it upon
were both brought up by hand she
and i had a general impression that
was a fair man with
of flaxen hair on each side
such a very undecided blue that
own whites he was
mild good natured sweet tempered
going foolish dear fellow
weakness my sister mrs joe
black hair and eyes
such a prevailing redness of
with a nutmeg grater instead of
almost always wore a
apron fastened over her figure behind with
loops and having a square
bib in front that was
full of pins and needles she
it a powerful merit in herself
a strong reproach against joe that
wore this apron so much
i really see no reason why
should have worn it at all
why if she did wear it at
she should not have
it off every day
her life joe s
adjoined our house which
the dwellings in our country were —most
i ran home from the churchyard the
kitchen joe and i being fellow
joe imparted a confidence
s dozen is she yes pip
s got tickler with her at
dismal intelligence i twisted the
button on my waistcoat round and
and looked in great depression at the
made a grab at tickler
she ram paged out that
slowly clearing the fire between the
child and as no more than
equal well said joe
on the ram page this last
a coming get behind the
you i took the advice
immediately divined the cause and applied
to its further investigation she
by throwing me—i often served as a
get hold of me on any
fenced me up there with his great
where have you been you young
said mrs joe stamping
foot tell me directly what you
been doing to wear me away with
and fright and worrit or
d have you out
that corner if you
fifty pips and he was
hundred gargerys i have only been
and rubbing myself churchyard repeated my
stayed there who brought you up
hand you did said
and why did i
know i don t said
sister i d never do it again
know that i may truly say
ve never had this apron of mine
since born you were it s bad
him a gargery without being
i looked disconsolately at the fire for
fugitive out on the marshes with
file the food and the dreadful
i was under to commit
churchyard indeed you may well say
you two one of
it at all you ll
me to the churchyard betwixt you one
these days and o a pr
recious pair you d be without me
she applied herself to
the tea things joe peeped
at me over his leg as if
and calculating what kind
under the grievous circumstances
and following mrs joe about with his
eyes as his manner always was
squally times my sister had
trenchant way of cutting our bread and
for us that never
first with her left hand
jammed the loaf hard and fast against
we afterwards got into our
then she took some
not too much on a knife
spread it on the loaf
were making a plaster —using both
trimming and moulding the butter
plaster and then sawed a very
round off the loaf which
finally before separating from the loaf hewed
one and i the other on
dared not eat my slice i felt
my dreadful acquaintance and his
the still more dreadful young man i
researches might find nothing available
butter down the leg of my
awful it was as if
had to make up my
depth of water and
was made the more difficult
the unconscious joe in our already
our evening habit to
our slices by silently holding them
to each other s
now and then —which
us to new exertions to night joe
times invited me by the
of his fast diminishing
to enter upon our
each time with my yellow mug of
untouched bread and butter on the other
with the circumstances i
joe had just looked
me and got my
and butter down my leg joe was
my loss of appetite and took a
bite out of his slice
he didn t seem to enjoy he
usual pondering over it a good
and after all gulped it
to take another bite
his eye fell on
butter was gone the wonder
and stared at me were
know muttered joe shaking
head at me in very serious remonstrance
yourself a mischief it
it pip what s the matter now
on it up pip
d recommend you to do it
she pounced on joe
taking him by the
whiskers knocked his head
a little while against
in the corner looking guiltily
now perhaps you ll
what s the matter said
sister out of breath you
great stuck pig joe looked
her in a helpless way
took a helpless bite and
at me again you know
said joe solemnly with his
bite in his cheek and speaking
i d be the last to tell
you any time but such a—
moved his chair and looked about the
at me— such a most
chap said joe looking at
and not at mrs joe with his
still in his cheek
bolted myself when i
ve been among a
bolters but i never
your bolting equal yet pip
t bolted dead my sister
more than the awful words
in the cupboard having a belief in
virtues correspondent to its nastiness
the best of times so much
this elixir was administered
me as a choice restorative
a new fence on this particular evening
urgency of my case demanded
for my greater comfort
under her arm as a boot
be held in a
joe got off with half a pint
was made to swallow
much to his disturbance as
fire because he had had a
had a turn afterwards if
had had none before
is a dreadful thing when it
boy that secret burden
down the leg of his trousers it
was going to rob joe for i
thought of any of the
property as his—united to the
of always keeping one hand on my
was ordered about the kitchen on any
winds made the fire glow and flare
thought i heard the
outside of the man with the iron
secrecy declaring that he couldn t
wouldn t starve until to morrow
imbruing his hands in
time and should think himself accredited
my heart and liver to night
of to morrow if
anybody s hair stood
from seven to eight by the dutch
i tried it with the
upon my leg and that made me
afresh of the man
and found the tendency of exercise
my ankle quite unmanageable happily
slipped away and deposited that part of
conscience in my garret bedroom hark said
in the chimney corner before being
up to bed was
great guns joe ah said
there s another conwict off what does
mean joe said i mrs joe who
took explanations upon herself said
needlework i put my mouth into the
of saying to joe what
a convict joe put his
into the forms of returning
a highly elaborate answer
i could make out nothing
it but the single word pip
was a conwict off last night said
who s firing said
drat that boy interposed my sister
at me over her work what a
you ll be told no
to herself i thought to
that i should be told lies
her even if i
point joe greatly augmented my curiosity
taking the utmost pains to
to put it into the form of
word that looked to
like sulks therefore i naturally
mouth into the form of saying
all and again opened his
could make nothing of the
mrs joe said i as a last
wouldn t much mind—where the firing
quite mean that but rather the
from the hulks oh h said i
at joe hulks joe gave a reproachful
as much as to
well i told you so and please
s hulks said i
sister pointing me out with her
and thread and shaking her
question and he ll
we always used that name for
in our country i wonder who s
into prison ships and why
re put there said
in a general way and
joe who immediately rose i tell
what young fellow said she
didn t bring you up
people are put in
hulks because they murder
because they rob and forge and do
bed i was never allowed
candle to light me to bed
dark with my head
—from mrs joe s thimble having
the tambourine upon it to
her last words —i felt
sensible of the great
that the hulks were
going to rob mrs joe since
time which is far enough
now i have often thought that
people know what secrecy there is in
young under terror no
how unreasonable the terror so
it be terror i was in mortal
of the young man who wanted my
and liver i was
leg i was in mortal
of myself from whom an awful promise
been extracted i had no
of deliverance through my all powerful
who repulsed me at every turn
am afraid to think of what i
of my terror if i
at all that night it was only
imagine myself drifting down
river on a strong spring tide to
hulks a ghostly pirate calling
to me through a
station that i had
come ashore and be hanged there at
been inclined for i knew that
the first faint dawn of
for there was no getting a light
easy friction then to
it out of flint and steel
have made a noise like
very pirate himself rattling his chains
soon as the great black velvet
outside my little window was shot
gray i got up and went down
every board upon the way
every crack in every board
joe in the pantry which
far more abundantly supplied
usual owing to the
by a hare hanging up by the
whom i rather thought i caught
my back was half turned
i had no time for verification
time for selection no
for anything for i had no
to spare i stole
bread some rind of
tied up in my pocket
decanted into a glass bottle i
secretly used for making that
my room diluting the stone
from a jug in the kitchen cupboard
meat bone with very little on it
a beautiful round compact pork pie i
was tempted to mount upon
was put away so carefully in
covered earthen ware dish in a
and i found it was the
that it was not intended for
time there was a door in the
unbolted that door and got a file
among joe s tools then i put
fastenings as i had found
opened the door at which
had entered when i ran home last
shut it and ran for
misty marshes chapter iii it was
my little window as if
for a pocket handkerchief now i
hedges and spare grass like
coarser sort of spiders webs hanging
from twig to twig and blade
on the post directing people to our
direction which they never accepted for
i was quite close
at it while it
it seemed to my
when i got out
the marshes so that instead
my running at everything
me through the mist as
they cried as plainly as could
else s pork pie stop him the
came upon me with like
staring out of their eyes
steaming out of their nostrils
with a white cravat on —who even
his blunt head round
such an accusatory manner as i
round that i blubbered out
him i couldn t help it sir
wasn t for myself i
smoke out of his
and vanished with a
up of his hind legs
a flourish of his tail all
time i was getting on towards
t warm my feet to which the
had been down there on a sunday
joe and joe sitting on an old
was prentice to him
last too far to the right and
had to try back
the river side on the
stakes that staked the tide out
which i knew to be
near the battery and
just scrambled up the
beyond the ditch when i saw
arms folded and was
be more glad if i
and it was not the same man
another man and yet
man was dressed in coarse
iron on his leg and was
everything that the other man
except that he had not the
face and had a flat broad
low crowned felt that
all this i saw
a moment for i had only
an oath at me made a hit
me —it was a round weak
down for it made him stumble
twice as he went and
i identified him i dare
had known where it was i
soon at the battery
that and there was the right
face and die of
cold his eyes looked so awfully
too that when i
him the file and he laid
down on the grass it occurred to
my bundle he did not
me upside down this time
me right side upwards
i opened the bundle and
my pockets what s
he was already handing mincemeat down
throat in the most
manner —more like a man who was
a man who was eating
take some of the liquor he shivered
as much as he could do to
the neck of the bottle between his
have got the ague said i i
much of your opinion boy
he it s bad about here
told him you ve been lying out
too i ll eat my
afore they re the death
me said he i d do
be strung up to
there gallows as there is over
directly afterwards i ll beat the
so far i ll bet you
all round us and often
stopping his jaws—to listen some
upon the river or breathing
start and he said suddenly —
the office to follow you
you d be but
fierce young hound indeed if
your time of life
could help to hunt a wretched warmint
as this poor wretched warmint is
clicked in his throat
if he had works in
like a clock and was going to
and he smeared his ragged rough
made bold to say i am glad
thankee my boy i do i had
i now noticed a decided similarity
the dog s way of eating and
man s the man took strong sharp
bites just like the
he swallowed or rather snapped up every
there while he ate as if he
s coming to take the
away he was altogether too unsettled
his mind over it to appreciate
dine with him without making a chop
all of which particulars he was very
the dog i am afraid you won
leave any of it for him
i timidly after a silence during
i had hesitated as to the politeness
making the remark there s
more to be got
that came from it was the
of this fact that impelled me
offer the hint leave any
in his crunching of pie
the young man that you spoke
gruff laugh him yes yes
and the greatest surprise looked
just now where yonder
i pointing over there where i
him nodding asleep and thought
was you he held
so that i began
had revived dressed like you you know
and with—the same reason
wanting to borrow a file didn t
hear the cannon last
then there was firing
said to himself i wonder you
t have been sure
heard it up at home
that s farther away
we were shut in
why see now said
a light stomach perishing of
and want he hears nothin
with their red coats
in round him hears his number
the muskets hears the orders make ready
hands on—and there s nothin why if
see one pursuing party last night—coming up
tramp—i see a hundred and
to firing why i see the
shake with the cannon
it was broad day —but this man
had said all the
my being there did you notice
he crammed what little
jacket show me the way he
a bloodhound curse this iron on
the file boy i indicated in what
on the rank wet grass filing at
iron like a madman
not minding me or minding
own leg which had an
chafe upon it and
bloody but which he handled as roughly
if it had no more feeling in
very much afraid of him
now that he had worked
was likewise very much
he took no notice so
thought the best thing
bent over his knee and he was
hard at his fetter muttering impatient
leg the last i heard of him
stopped in the mist
listen and the file was still
chapter iv i fully expected to find
constable in the kitchen waiting to take
up but not only
there no constable there
getting the house ready for
festivities of the day and joe had
to keep him out of the
pan —an article into which his
always led him sooner
later when my sister was
what s the same
i should have been to hear the
s the best of
for my never hearing any
who had ventured into the
retired before us drew the back
his hand across his
with a conciliatory air
mrs joe darted a
were withdrawn secretly crossed his
forefingers and exhibited them to
in a cross temper
was so much her
state that joe and i would often
as to their legs we
to have a superb
consisting of a leg of pickled pork
greens and a pair of roast
fowls a handsome mince pie had
made yesterday morning which accounted for
ain t said mrs
— i ain t a
to have no formal cramming and busting
washing up now with
i ve got before
i promise you so
had our slices served out
if we were two thousand troops on
and boy at home and we
state parlor across the passage which
never uncovered at any
time but passed the
of the year in a cool haze
silver paper which even extended to
the mantel shelf each with a
nose and a basket of flowers in
mouth and each the counterpart of
clean housekeeper but had
uncomfortable and unacceptable than
itself cleanliness is next to godliness
some people do the
by their religion my sister
so much to do
joe and i were going
holiday clothes he was more like a
in good circumstances than anything
nothing that he wore then
him or seemed to
present festive occasion he
from his room when the
bells were going the picture of
penitentials as to me i think
sister must have had
general idea that i was
be dealt with according to the outraged
if i had insisted on
born in opposition to the dictates
reason religion and morality
against the dissuading arguments of
to have a new
of clothes the tailor had orders
make them like a kind of
and on no account to let me
the free use of
limbs joe and i
to church therefore must have
minds yet what i suffered outside
that had assailed me whenever mrs
had gone near the
be equalled by the remorse
which my mind dwelt on
secret i pondered whether
church would be powerful enough to shield
to that establishment i conceived
idea that the time when the
were read and when
clergyman said ye are
to declare it would be the
am far from being sure that i
not have astonished our
congregation by resorting to this extreme measure
for its being christmas day and no
hubble the wheelwright and mrs hubble and
pumblechook joe s uncle but
joe appropriated him who was a well
do cornchandler in the nearest
and drove his own
cart the dinner hour was half
one when joe and
and mrs joe dressed and the dinner
a word of the robbery
time came without bringing with
any relief to my
united to a roman nose
a deep voice which he was
proud of indeed it was understood among
acquaintance that if you could
would read the clergyman into fits he
confessed that if the church was
open meaning to competition
would not despair of making his
in it the church not being thrown
he was as i have
and when he gave out
first as much as to say
have heard my friend overhead oblige
with your opinion of this
it first to mr wopsle
to mr and mrs hubble and last
all to uncle pumblechook n
said uncle pumblechook a large hard
middle aged slow man with a mouth
sandy hair standing upright on his head
been all but choked and
that moment come to
season—i have brought you mum a bottle
you mum a bottle of port
every christmas day he presented himself
mrs joe replied as she now
christmas day he retorted as
now retorted it s
more than your merits and now
you all bobbish and
s sixpennorth of halfpence
me we dined on
occasions in the kitchen and adjourned for
change very like joe
to his sunday dress
sister was uncommonly lively
the present occasion and indeed was
more gracious in the society of
hubble than in other company i remember
who held a conventionally
don t know at what remote period
remember mr hubble as a tough high
stooping old man of a
fragrance with his legs extraordinarily
country between them when i
company i should have felt
even if i hadn t
i was squeezed in at an
angle of the tablecloth
elbow in my eye nor
i was not allowed
nor because i was regaled with the
tips of the drumsticks
the fowls and with those
corners of pork of
the pig when living had
the least reason to be
minded that if they would only have
me alone but they wouldn
leave me alone they seemed to think
opportunity lost if they failed
point the conversation at me
me i might have been an
arena i got so smartingly
appears to me something like a religious
very proper aspiration that
sister fixed me with her eye
pumblechook be grateful boy
them which brought you
by hand mrs hubble shook her head
presentiment that i should
are never grateful this moral mystery
too much for the company
mr hubble tersely solved it by
at me in a particularly unpleasant and
aided and comforted me when he could
at dinner time by giving
plenty of gravy to
joe spooned into my plate at
point about half a
a little later on in the
mr wopsle reviewed the
the usual hypothetical case of
he would have given
after favoring them with some heads of
homily ill chosen which was the less
pumblechook you ve hit it sir plenty
ready with his salt box mr pumblechook
for the young returned mr
—and i knew he
text you listen to this said my
to me in a
the companions of the prodigal the gluttony
example to the young i thought this
well in him who had been praising
the pork for being so plump
juicy what is detestable in
pig is more detestable
a boy or girl suggested
there is no girl present besides
mr pumblechook turning sharp on
squeaker— he was if ever a child
said my sister most
gravy well but i
pumblechook if you had
form said mr wopsle
towards the dish but i
pumblechook who had an objection to being
i mean enjoying himself with his
conversation and rolling in the lap
doing that no he wouldn t and
turning on me again you would have
disposed of for so many shillings
to the market price
would have come up to you
you lay in your straw and
he would have tucked up his
to get a penknife
out of his waistcoat pocket and
would have shed your blood
hand then not a
of it joe offered
more gravy which i
world of trouble to
ma am said mrs hubble
my sister trouble echoed
of sleeplessness i had committed
all the high places
i had tumbled into and all
injuries i had done myself and all
times she had wished
contumaciously refused to go
i think the romans must have aggravated
another very much with their
perhaps they became the
people they were in consequence anyhow mr
s roman nose so
me during the recital of my
that i should have
this time was nothing in
broken which ensued upon my sister
recital and in which
indignation and abhorrence yet said mr
from which they had
it had come at last
would find it was weak
both hands and awaited my fate
came back with the stone bottle
poured his brandy out no one
the light put it down —prolonged
misery all this time mrs joe
joe were briskly clearing
couldn t keep my
hands and feet i
the miserable creature finger
glass playfully take it up smile throw
spasmodic whooping cough dance and rushing out
the door he then
visible through the window violently plunging
expectorating making the most hideous faces
held on tight while mrs
and joe ran to him i
it but i had
doubt i had murdered him
in my dreadful situation it was
they had disagreed with him sank down
the tar water jug i
he would be worse by
by i moved the
by the vigor of my unseen
upon it tar cried my sister in
wouldn t hear the word wouldn t
of the subject imperiously waved it all
with his hand and asked
hot gin and water my sister
the gin the hot
the sugar and the lemon peel
at least i was
degrees i became calm
to release my grasp
mr pumblechook had begun
said to joe clean plates —cold
clutched the leg of the table again
and pressed it to my bosom
if it had been the companion of
i foresaw what was coming
i felt that this
taste said my sister addressing the guests
her best grace— you must taste
finish with such a delightful and
present of uncle pumblechook
my sister rising it s a pie
savory pork pie the company
their compliments uncle pumblechook sensible of having
well of his fellow creatures said —quite
joe we ll do our best
let us have a
at this same pie my sister went
to get it i
her steps proceed to
pantry i saw mr pumblechook balance
knife i saw reawakening
heard mr hubble remark that a bit
savory pork pie would lay atop of
you could mention and do no harm
i heard joe say you
shrill yell of terror merely in spirit
no more and that
must run away i released the leg
the table and ran for my
ran head foremost into a
of soldiers with their muskets one of
sharp come on chapter v the apparition
a file of soldiers ringing down
caused mrs joe re entering the
staring at which crisis i partially recovered
the sergeant who had spoken to
his left on my shoulder excuse me
have mentioned at the door to
i am on a chase
you want with him
sergeant speaking for myself
should reply the honor and
speaking for the king i answer
the sergeant who had by
eye we have had an accident with

you throw your eye over them
would take nearer two hours
one will it then will you
about it at once blacksmith said
off hand sergeant as it
on his majesty s
men who came trooping into the
one after another and piled their arms
a corner and then
resting a knee or
shoulder now easing a
door to spit stiffly over their
all these things i saw without then
that i saw them for i was
an agony of apprehension but
to perceive that the
were not for me and that
military had so far got
it in the background i collected a
me the time said
sergeant addressing himself to
whose appreciative powers justified
inference that he was equal to
time it s just gone half past
that s not so bad said
sergeant reflecting even if i
forced to halt here nigh two
that ll do how far
you call yourselves from the marshes hereabouts
above a mile i reckon
a mile said mrs joe that
do we begin to close in
em about dusk a little before dusk
orders are that ll do
sergeant asked mr wopsle in a matter
sergeant two they re
well known to be out

the sergeant they ll
themselves trapped in a circle

taking the course i
begun with and from
i had diverged in
again yet or the
had dispelled it under the low
and the gibbet and the mound
the battery and the opposite shore of

of a watery lead
a blacksmith at joe s broad shoulder
looked all about for any sign
i could hear none
wopsle had greatly alarmed
and hard breathing but i

stared angrily as if they held
responsible for both annoyances but except these
day in every blade of grass
was no break in the bleak
and we were moving on a
us on the wings of
wind and rain a long shout
was repeated it was at a

the sergeant and the nearest men were
under their breath when
and i came up after another moment
listening joe who was a
judge agreed and mr wopsle
was a bad judge

hold on tight to keep my seat
called in the only
words he spoke all the
up banks and over gates

this way for the runaway
stifled in a struggle and then would
out again and when
had come to this the
ran like deer and joe
the sergeant ran in
when we had run
noise quite down and two of his
ran in close upon him their
were cocked and levelled
men panted the sergeant struggling
two and confound you for
wild beasts come asunder water was splashing
mud was flying and
my convict and the other one
were bleeding and panting
execrating and struggling but
hair from his fingers i
him i give him up to you
that it s not much to be
about said the sergeant it ll
you small good my
being in the same plight yourself handcuffs
greedy laugh i took him
knows it that s enough for
and in addition to the old
left side of his face
to be bruised and torn all over
could not so much
soldier to keep himself from falling take
guard —he tried to murder me were
him said my convict disdainfully try
i not only prevented him
off the marshes but i dragged
way back he s a gentleman
you please this villain now the
has got its gentleman again through me
him worth my while
to murder him when i could
other one still gasped
tried—he tried to—murder me bear—bear witness
here said my convict to
prison ship i made a dash
i done it i could ha got
my leg you won
find much iron on it—if i
free let him profit
out let him make a tool of
afresh and again once more no
there and he made
to him with that grip that
should have been safe to find him
my hold the other
who was evidently in
horror of his companion repeated
tried to murder me i should have
a dead man if you
not come up he lies said
convict with fierce energy he
a liar born and
ll die a liar
i defy him to do
smile which could not however collect
looked about at the marshes and
not look at the speaker
s how he looked
we were tried together
dry lips and turning his eyes restlessly
him far and near did at last
them for a moment on the
with the words you are not much
look at and with a half taunting
that he would have rushed upon

the other convict then that
would murder me if he could and
one could see that he
with fear and that there broke out
snow enough of this parley said
of a gun went down on his
to open it my convict looked round
for the first time and saw
i had alighted from joe s back
came up and had
me and slightly moved my hands
shook my head i had
waiting for him to see me
at all expressed to me
he even comprehended my
for he gave me
moment but if he
not have remembered his face ever
light and lighted three or four torches
took one himself and distributed the others
had been almost dark before but
four soldiers standing in a
fired twice into the air
we saw other torches kindled at
marshes on the opposite bank
the river all right said the sergeant
we had not gone
when three cannon were
that seemed to burst something inside
ear you are expected on board said
coming don t straggle my man close
here the two were kept
the torches mr wopsle
been for going back but joe
resolved to see it out so
went on with the party there was
divergence here and there
it and a muddy sluice gate
the torches we carried
great blotches of fire upon the
and i could see
too lying smoking and flaring i could
warmed the air about us with their
blaze and the two
seemed rather to like
as they limped along in
not go fast because of
lameness and they were so
that two or three times we
to halt while they rested after an
or so of this travelling
hut where there was a
of tobacco and whitewash and a
fire and a lamp and a
of muskets and a
and a low wooden bedstead
capable of holding about
soldiers who lay upon it in their
us but just lifted their
entry in a book and then the
whom i call the other convict
drafted off with his guard
that once while we stood
fire looking thoughtfully at it
putting up his feet by turns
the hob and looking thoughtfully at them
if he pitied them for their recent
sergeant and remarked — i wish
say something respecting this escape
you like returned the
standing coolly looking at him with
arms folded but you have no call
say it here you ll have opportunity
to say about it
hear about it before it s
with you know i
but this is another pint a separate

at least i can t
over yonder —where the church
stole said the sergeant and
blacksmith s halloa said
was—and a dram of liquor and a
asked the sergeant confidentially my
came in don t
know pip so said my convict
his eyes on joe in a moody
and without the least glance at
— so you re
blacksmith are you than i
sorry to say i ve eat
with a saving remembrance of mrs
fellow creatur —would us

returned and his guard were ready
of rough stakes and stones and saw
put into the boat which was
by a crew of convicts like
no one seemed surprised to see him
interested in seeing him or
to see him or
to see him or spoke a
except that somebody in the boat growled
we saw the black hulk
the shore like a wicked

and moored by massive
chains the prison ship

each country also has
fifty states other countries represented with domains
the united kingdom these also have
domains of things like ac uk for
sites and co uk

better connectivity for the network as

grave electronic mail the desire to communicate

the section on networking basics made
your email address provides all
these cases are the exception
the norm mail to most
is read by human beings symbolic cacophony

it acts as an extra ``routing
for example if the

the system though it

the name of a system

australia ca canada fr

of the necessary information to

may 1991 by spaf cs
edu gene spafford the
thing to understand about usenet
the elephant phenomenon appears in spades
the opinion of the
more flame wars rabid arguments arise
on usenet imagine then how poorly
on the nature of usenet
ignore the erroneous impressions held by
usenet users therefore this section
alas is not relevant to usenet what
is usenet is the set of
one or more universally recognized labels
newsgroups or ``groups for short note that
board bboard conference round table sig etc
incorrect if you want
usenet if the above
of usenet sounds vague that
because it is it is almost impossible
generalize over all usenet sites in any
trivial way usenet encompasses government
large universities high schools businesses of
sizes home computers of
descriptions etc every administrator
has any real control over any
but his own the
the system he administers as
as the owner is happy with
job the administrator is doing
can do whatever he pleases up
c est la vie what usenet
not usenet is not an organization usenet
no central authority in fact it has
``upstream and ``downstream related to the direction
high volume news flow
follows that to the extent that ``upstream
decide what traffic they will carry for
``downstream neighbors that ``upstream sites have some
on their neighbors but such influence
people however as explained
usenet is not an organization
only an organization can
run as a democracy even a democracy
be organized for if
lacks a means of

fair after all who shall
what s fair for that
is not a right some
misunderstand their local right of

to use others computers to say
they wish in whatever
those people are wrong freedom of
choose not to use my
who own one usenet
by plain count are not there
no control usenet is not
commercial network many usenet sites are
or government organizations in
usenet originated in academia therefore
if such commercial traffic is
considered worth carrying then
may be grudgingly tolerated even so it
usually separated somehow from non
traffic see comp newprod
is not the internet the internet is
many kinds of traffic usenet is only
of them and the internet
only one of the
networks carrying usenet traffic usenet is not

reposeful and inviting tom appeared
fence and all gladness left him and
deep melancholy settled down
his spirit thirty yards of
burden sighing he dipped his
reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence and sat
on a tree box discouraged
gals bringing water from the town

and examined it bits of toys
and trash enough to buy an exchange
work maybe but not half

on her gray head for safety

wondered at seeing him place himself
way he said mayn t
go and play now
what a ready how
me i can t bear
aunt polly placed small
in such evidence she went out to
for herself and she would have
content to find twenty per cent
tom s statement true when
only whitewashed but elaborately
and recoated and even a
added to the ground her astonishment was
unspeakable she said well i never there
no getting round it
can work when you re a mind
tom and then she diluted the compliment
seldom you re a mind to
long and play but
splendor of his achievement that
took him into the

lecture upon the added
and flavor a treat took
itself when it came without
through virtuous effort and
hooked a doughnut then he
out and saw sid just
up the outside stairway that
second floor clods were handy and the
and before aunt polly could collect her
six or seven clods had taken
effect and tom was over the fence
as a general thing
was too crowded for time to make
that he had settled with sid
calling attention to his black
into a muddy alley
led by the back of
aunt s cow stable
presently got safely beyond the reach
public square of the village
two military companies of boys
joe harper a bosom friend
still smaller fry but sat together
an eminence and conducted the
operations by orders delivered through
de camp tom s army won a
victory after a long and
were counted prisoners exchanged the terms of
next disagreement agreed upon and
day for the necessary battle appointed after
the armies fell into line
marched away and tom turned
where jeff thatcher lived he saw a
plaited into two long tails white
frock and embroidered pantalettes
fresh crowned hero fell without firing a
a certain amy lawrence vanished out of
heart and left not even
he loved her to
he had been the happiest and the
days and here in one
of time she had gone out of
done he worshipped this new angel with
eye till he saw that
he did not know
was present and began to
admiration he kept up
of some dangerous gymnastic performances he glanced
and saw that the little girl
wending her way toward the house tom
on it grieving and hoping
would tarry yet awhile longer she halted
the door tom heaved a
away for she tossed
pansy over the fence a moment
his eyes with his
and began to look down street
if he had discovered something of
presently he picked up a
and as he moved
side to side in his
pansy finally his bare foot
upon it his pliant toes closed upon
and he hopped away with the
flower inside his jacket next his
or next his stomach possibly
he was not much
exhibited herself again though tom comforted himself
near some window meantime and
aware of his attentions
he strode home reluctantly with
supper his spirits were so high
a good scolding about clodding sid
did not seem to mind it in
and got his knuckles
for it he said aunt
don t whack sid when he
it well sid don
do you d be always
you presently she stepped
the kitchen and sid happy in his
wellnigh unbearable but sid s fingers slipped
the bowl dropped and broke tom was
his tongue and was silent
said to himself that
would not speak a word even when
aunt came in but would sit perfectly
till she asked who did
mischief and then he would tell
there would be nothing so
model catch it he
so brimful of exultation
he could hardly hold himself when
to himself now it
coming and the next
he was sprawling on the floor
potent palm was uplifted
out hold on now what er you
you didn t get a lick
i reckon you been
some other audacious mischief when i
t around like enough then her
reproached her and she yearned to
this would be construed into
about her affairs with a troubled heart
he knew that in
heart his aunt was
her knees to him
the consciousness of it he
he knew that a yearning
fell upon him now and
through a film of tears but
lying sick unto death and
aunt bending over him
one little forgiving word but he would
die with that word unsaid ah how
she feel then and he
himself brought home from the
wet and his sore heart at
pray god to give
back her boy and she would never
abuse him any more
sign a poor little sufferer whose griefs
upon his feelings with the pathos
these dreams that he
to keep swallowing he was so
to choke and his eyes
which overflowed when he winked and
down and trickled from the end
his nose and such a luxury
that he could not
to have any worldly cheeriness or any
so presently when his cousin
seeing home again after
clouds and darkness out
one door as she
song and sunshine in at the other
haunts of boys and sought desolate
and he seated himself on its outer
of the stream wishing the while
devised by nature then he
and wilted and it mightily
would pity him if she knew
she cry and wish that she had
right to put her arms
turn coldly away like
the hollow world this picture brought such
his mind and set it up in
it threadbare at last he rose
came along the deserted street
where the adored unknown lived
fell upon his listening ear a
window was the sacred presence there
climbed the fence threaded
stealthy way through the plants till he
it disposing himself upon his back with
poor wilted flower and thus he
shelter over his homeless head no
hand to wipe the death damps from
brow no loving face to
pityingly over him when the great agony
looked out upon the glad morning
upon his poor lifeless form would
untimely cut down the window
snort there was a whiz
of a missile in the air
with the murmur of a curse a
shot away in the gloom not
after as tom all undressed
bed was surveying his
tallow dip sid woke up
making any references to
and held his peace
there was danger in tom s
prayers and sid made mental note
the omission chapter iv the sun rose
a tranquil world and beamed down
it began with a
built from the ground
originality and from the summit of
the mosaic law as
sinai then tom girded
get his verses sid
bent all his energies
and he chose part of
sermon on the mount
he could find no
that were shorter at the end of
an hour tom had a vague general
of his lesson but no more
through the fog blessed are the a
poor yes poor blessed
the poor a a in
in spirit blessed are the poor in
for they they theirs for theirs
are the poor in
for theirs is the kingdom
heaven blessed are they that mourn for
what it is shall oh

if you do i ll

i ll tackle it
a brand new barlow
cents and the convulsion
in that though where the western
ever got the idea
such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited
its injury is an imposing mystery
will always remain so perhaps
contrived to scarify the cupboard with it
dress for sunday school
gave him a tin
of water and a
of soap and he
on a little bench there
he dipped the soap in the
and laid it down turned up
sleeves poured out the
on the ground gently and then entered
kitchen and began to wipe
door but mary removed the
and said now ain t you
tom you mustn t
you tom was a trifle disconcerted the
was refilled and this time he stood
it a little while gathering resolution
in a big breath and began when
eyes shut and groping for
towel with his hands an
testimony of suds and water
dripping from his face
when he emerged from the
he was not yet satisfactory for
clean territory stopped short at his
and his jaws like
mask below and beyond this line there
downward in front and backward around his
was a man and a brother without
of color and his saturated hair was
dainty and symmetrical general
he privately smoothed out
curls with labor and difficulty and
his hair close down to his head
own filled his life with bitterness
mary got out a
of his clothing that had been used
they were simply called his other clothes
so by that we know the size
his wardrobe the girl put him to
after he had dressed
to his chin turned his vast shirt
down over his shoulders
him off and crowned him with
speckled straw hat he now
exceedingly improved and uncomfortable he was
as uncomfortable as he
galled him he hoped
mary would forget his
she coated them thoroughly
persuasively please tom that s a good
sid and mary were fond of
sabbath school hours were from nine
half past ten and then
service two of the
and the other always remained
backed uncushioned pews would seat about three
plain affair with a sort of
board tree box on top
tom dropped back a step and
a sunday dressed comrade say billy got
yaller ticket yes what
piece of lickrish and a
hook less see em tom exhibited
were satisfactory and the
changed hands then tom traded
trifle or other for a
of blue ones he waylaid
boys as they came and went on
tickets of various colors ten
fifteen minutes longer he entered the
now with a swarm of clean and
boys and girls proceeded
his seat and started a
with the first boy that came
the teacher a grave elderly man
then turned his back a moment
tom pulled a boy s hair in
next bench and was absorbed in his
when the boy turned
presently in order to
from his teacher tom s whole class
when they came to recite
lessons not one of
knew his verses perfectly but
through and each got
reward in small blue
each with a passage of
pay for two verses of the
could be exchanged for
ten red tickets equalled a yellow one
a very plainly bound
worth forty cents in those
times to the pupil how many
my readers would have the

won four or five he
stopping but the strain upon his
faculties was too great and
was little better than
idiot from that day forth
on great occasions before
it had always made
delivery of one of these prizes
the successful pupil was so
and conspicuous for that day
on the spot every scholar
often lasted a couple of
it is possible that tom
one of those prizes but unquestionably his
being had for many a day
for the glory and
eclat that came with it
due course the superintendent stood up
hymn book in his hand and
attention when a sunday school superintendent
as is the inevitable sheet
music in the hand of
the platform and sings a solo
a concert though why is
nor the sheet of music is ever
to by the sufferer this superintendent
standing collar whose upper edge
reached his ears and
sharp points curved forward abreast the corners
required his chin was
ends his boot toes were turned
patiently and laboriously produced by
young men by sitting with
toes pressed against a wall for
mien and very sincere and honest at
and places in such reverence and so
them from worldly matters that
to himself his sunday
up just as straight and pretty
you can and give
all your attention for a minute
two there that is it that
should do i see one
girl who is looking out
somewhere perhaps up in one of the
making a speech to the little birds
titter i want to tell you how
bright clean little faces assembled in
place like this learning to do right
so on it is not necessary to
was of a pattern which does not
the latter third of the speech was
other recreations among certain
the bad boys and by fidgetings and
that extended far and wide washing
rocks like sid and mary
good part of the whispering had been
by an event which was
or less rare the entrance of
lawyer thatcher accompanied by a very
and aged man a fine portly middle
gentleman with iron gray hair and a
lady who was doubtless the latter s
had been restless and full of
and repinings conscience smitten
he could not meet
lawrence s eye he could not
all ablaze with bliss in a moment
with all his might cuffing
word using every art that seemed likely
exaltation had but one alloy the
of happiness that were sweeping over
now the visitors were
the highest seat of honor and
soon as mr walters speech was
he introduced them to the school
middle aged man turned
one than the county judge
had ever looked upon and
wondered what kind of material
half wanted to hear him roar
were half afraid he
too he was from constantinople
miles away so he had travelled and
the world these very eyes
which was said to
reflections inspired was attested by the impressive
brother of their own lawyer jeff
immediately went forward to
familiar with the great man and be
look at him jim
he s a going to shake
with him he is shaking hands
official bustlings and activities giving
showed off running hither and
with his arms full
books and making a deal
bending sweetly over pupils that were lately
boxed lifting pretty warning
good ones lovingly the young gentlemen
the teachers of both sexes found business
be done over again
or three times with much seeming
ways and the little
that the air was
with paper wads and the murmur
judicial smile upon all the house and
own grandeur for he was
to make mr walters ecstasy complete
several pupils had a few
tickets but none had
he had been around among the
pupils inquiring he would
hope was dead tom sawyer came forward
nine yellow tickets nine red tickets
bible this was a thunderbolt
for the next ten years
there was no getting around it here
their face tom was therefore elevated to
announced from headquarters it was the most
surprise of the decade and so profound
new hero up to the judicial
s altitude and the school had two
who perceived too late that they
by trading tickets to tom for the
the dupes of a wily fraud
much effusion as the
could pump up under
circumstances but it lacked
him that there was a mystery here
two thousand sheaves of scriptural wisdom
was proud and glad and she tried
make tom see it in
face but he wouldn t
glance told her worlds
hated everybody tom most
introduced to the judge but his
was tied his breath would hardly come
heart quaked partly because of the awful
of the man but mainly because he
liked to fall down and
judge put his hand on tom
head and called him
name was the boy stammered gasped
was more to it maybe that s
well but you ve another one
daresay and you ll tell
gentleman your other name thomas said walters
say sir you mustn
forget your manners thomas sawyer
fellow two thousand verses is
great many very very great
the trouble you took to
them for knowledge is worth more than
what makes great men and good
you ll be a great
thomas and then you ll look
and say it s all owing
boyhood it s all owing to
dear teachers that taught me
learn it s all owing to
a beautiful bible a splendid elegant
to keep and have
all for my own
say thomas and you

wouldn t and now you wouldn t
things you ve learned no i know
wouldn t for we
proud of little boys
know the names of
the twelve disciples won t
sheepish he blushed now
it is not possible that
boy can answer the simplest question why
t be afraid tom still hung fire
i know you ll tell me
the lady the names of the first
disciples were david and
let us draw the curtain of charity
the rest of the scene chapter
bell of the small church
the sunday school children
themselves about the house and occupied
with their parents so
to be under supervision aunt polly came
tom and sid and mary sat with
tom being placed next the aisle
order that he might

the model boy willie mufferson taking
heedful care of his
and was the pride of
the matrons the boys all hated
he was so good and besides
as usual on sundays
tom had no handkerchief and he
snobs the congregation being
once more to warn
and stragglers and then a
hush fell upon the
which was only broken by
tittering and whispering of the choir
the gallery the choir
tittered and whispered all through service
was once a church
that was not ill bred but i
a great many years
and i can scarcely remember anything
it but i think it was in
foreign country the minister gave
a relish in a peculiar style
was much admired in that
of the country his voice began on
bore with strong emphasis upon
whilst others fight to
the prize and sail
as a wonderful reader
was through the ladies would lift
their laps and wall their
and shake their heads as
it it is too beautiful too
for this mortal earth
the hymn had been

of doom a queer custom

into details it pleaded

boy whose history this book relates
not enjoy the prayer
only endured it if he even
that much he was restive
the details of the prayer unconsciously for
was not listening but he knew
ground of old and the clergyman s
route over it and when a little
ear detected it and
whole nature resented it he considered additions
and scoundrelly in the midst of the
a fly had lit
the back of the pew
front of him and tortured his
it so vigorously that
seemed to almost part
with the body and the slender
of a neck was exposed
as indeed it was for
grab for it they did not
with the closing sentence his hand began
curve and steal forward and the instant
was a prisoner of
his aunt detected the act and
many a head by and
began to nod and
it was an argument that
in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned
predestined elect down to
company so small as to be
worth the saving tom counted the pages
the sermon after church
always knew how many pages
had been but he
knew anything else about
discourse however this time
while the minister made a
together of the world s
lion and the lamb should lie down
them but the pathos
lesson the moral of
nations his face lit with
be that child if
into suffering again as the dry argument
resumed presently he bethought him of
treasure he had and
it out it was a large black
it it was in a percussion
natural fillip followed the beetle
back and the hurt finger went into
boy s mouth the beetle lay
working its helpless legs
and longed for it but it
safe out of his reach
people uninterested in the sermon found relief
the beetle and they eyed
too presently a vagrant poodle dog
the summer softness and the
weary of captivity sighing for change
spied the beetle the
tail lifted and wagged he
the prize walked around it smelt at
from a safe distance walked around it
grew bolder and took a closer
then lifted his lip and made
gingerly snatch at it
another began to enjoy
diversion subsided to his
with the beetle between his paws
continued his experiments grew weary at last
then indifferent and absent minded
his chin descended and
sharp yelp a flirt of the poodle
and tom was entirely happy
dog looked foolish and probably felt
his heart too and a craving for
and began a wary attack on it
a circle lighting with his fore paws
even closer snatches at it with his
and jerking his head till his ears
again but he grew tired once
himself with a fly but found no
followed an ant around
his nose close to the floor and
beetle entirely and sat down on it
there was a wild yelp of agony
he crossed the house in front of
altar he flew down the other
he crossed before the doors
anguish grew with his progress till
he was but a woolly comet moving
its orbit with the
and the speed of light at last
flung it out of the window and
in the distance by
time the whole church was red faced
suffocating with suppressed laughter and the
standstill the discourse was resumed presently but
for even the gravest sentiments
constantly being received with a smothered burst
unholy mirth under cover of
remote pew back as if the
parson had said a rarely facetious
cheerful thinking to himself that there
some satisfaction about divine service when
was a bit of
thought he was willing that the dog
think it was upright
morning found tom sawyer miserable monday morning
found him so because
it made the going into
and fetters again so much
odious tom lay thinking presently it occurred
school here was a vague possibility
canvassed his system no
symptoms and he began to
them with considerable hope but
soon grew feeble and presently died wholly
as he called it when
court with that argument his
would hurt so he thought he would
the tooth in reserve for the
and seek further nothing
for some little time
then he remembered hearing
doctor tell about a
to make him lose a
toe from under the
the necessary symptoms however it
well worth while to chance
so he fell to groaning with
groaned louder and fancied that he
no result from sid tom
panting with his exertions by this time
then brought himself up on his
with a snort and began to
tom what is the matter
why what s the matter tom
must call auntie no never mind it
be over by and by maybe
t call anybody but i
don t groan so tom
s awful how long you
don t stir so sid you ll

crawl to hear you tom what is

to me when i m
oh tom you ain
dying are you don t tom oh

window sash and my
with one eye to that new
groans had gathered quite a genuine tone
flew down stairs and

fled up stairs nevertheless with sid
face grew white too and
lip trembled when she
the bedside she gasped

toe s mortified the old lady

your outrageousness by this time the dental
were ready the old lady made one
tom s tooth with a loop
tied the other to the bedpost
as tom wended to school after breakfast
was the envy of every boy
his upper row of teeth enabled him
expectorate in a new
admirable way he gathered quite a
of lads interested in the exhibition
and homage up to
adherent and shorn of his glory his
did not feel that
wasn t anything to
like tom sawyer but another boy
dismantled hero shortly tom came upon the
pariah of the village huckleberry finn son
the town drunkard huckleberry was cordially hated
all their children admired him
respectable boys in that he envied huckleberry
under strict orders not
played with him every time he
a chance huckleberry was
dressed in the cast off clothes of
in perennial bloom and
ruin with a wide crescent
when he wore one hung
back but one suspender supported
trousers the seat of the trousers bagged
and contained nothing the fringed legs

fine weather and in empty
to church or call any being master

paper and carefully unrolled
huckleberry viewed it wistfully the temptation was
strong at last he said is it
a trade tom enclosed the tick in
percussion cap box that had lately been
separated each feeling wealthier than
speed he hung his hat
with business like alacrity the master
on high in his great splint bottom
chair was dozing lulled by the
hum of study the
full it meant trouble sir come up
now sir why are
late again as usual tom was
to take refuge in a lie when
saw two long tails of yellow hair
the electric sympathy of
girls side of the schoolhouse
instantly said i stopped
pulse stood still and he stared
the buzz of study ceased the pupils
if this foolhardy boy had
his mind the master said
huckleberry finn there was no
the words thomas sawyer this
the most astounding confession i have
will answer for this offence take
your jacket the master
stock of switches notably diminished
with the girls and let this be
warning to you the titter that
around the room appeared to
of his unknown idol and the
pleasure that lay in
high good fortune he sat
upon the end of the
bench and the girl hitched herself away
him with a toss of
head nudges and winks and
traversed the room but
sat still with his arms
and by attention ceased
him and the accustomed school
rose upon the dull
it made a mouth at him and
him the back of her head
the space of a
when she cautiously faced around again
peach lay before her she thrust
then she let it remain tom scrawled
his slate please take it i got
to draw something on the slate hiding
work with his left hand for
time the girl refused to
but her human curiosity presently began to
itself by hardly perceptible signs the boy
on apparently unconscious the
made a sort of noncommittal attempt to
a house with two gable
to it and a
of smoke issuing from the chimney then
girl s interest began
fasten itself upon the work
she forgot everything else
it was finished she gazed a
a man the artist erected a
in the front yard that
a derrick he could have stepped
and whispered it s
beautiful man now make me coming along
drew an hour glass with a full
and straw limbs to it

so nice i wish i could

deed and double deed won t
won t tell anybody
all ever as long as
put her small hand upon his and
to resist in earnest
words were revealed i love you oh
bad thing and she hit his hand
looked pleased nevertheless just at this juncture
boy felt a slow
grip closing on his ear
a steady lifting impulse in
wise he was borne across the house
deposited in his own seat
a peppering fire of
from the whole school then the master
finally moved away to
jubilant as the school quieted down tom
his place in the reading class and

times because of a
juvenile superstition that to cross

far away into unknown

clown recurred to him
only to fill him with
for frivolity and jokes and spotted tights
upon a spirit that was exalted into
long years all war
he would join the indians and hunt
and go on the warpath
the mountain ranges and
back a great chief bristling with feathers
with paint and prance into
school some drowsy summer morning with
bloodcurdling war whoop and sear the
of all his companions with unappeasable envy
no there was something gaudier even
lay plain before him and glowing
unimaginable splendor how his name would

flag flying at the fore and at
zenith of his fame how he
suddenly appear at the old
and stalk into church brown and weather
in his black velvet doublet and
his great jack boots his
pistols his crime rusted cutlass at

would satisfy himself on that
so he searched around till
found a small sandy spot
close to this depression and called

by the treacherous nun to bleed his
away through his neglected wound and at
gave his bow into his feeble

a nettle and sprang up
gaily for a corpse the boys dressed
hid their accoutrements and went off grieving

joe sprang to his
his eyes flaming with passion
up potter s knife and went
catlike and stooping round
round about the combatants seeking
opportunity all at once

close to the wall with some
ceremonies and incantations and
fetters that bound their tongues were
to be locked and the key
away a figure crept
they did not notice
tom whispered huckleberry does

don t you know that
to whisper for some
time presently a dog set up
long lugubrious howl just outside

which of us does he mean gasped

hearts had stood still and their hopes
when the man moved but their fears

little distance to exchange
on the night air again
within a few feet of
nose pointing heavenward oh geeminy it

sid was dressed and
him with bodings within
stairs feeling sore and drowsy
had finished breakfast there was no voice
there was a silence and an
of solemnity that struck a
to the culprit s heart he sat
roused no smile no
and let his heart sink down
hope that he was
to be flogged but
told him to go
and ruin himself and bring her
hairs with sorrow to the
her to try any
this was worse than
thousand whippings and tom s
he pleaded for forgiveness promised to
over and over again and then

evidence and arriving at
roads in every direction and the
was confident that he would
captured before night all the
joined the procession not because
would not a thousand
rather go anywhere else but
an awful unaccountable fascination drew him on
at the dreadful place he wormed
small body through the
and saw the dismal spectacle it seemed
was there before somebody pinched his arm
then both looked elsewhere
once and wondered if anybody
noticed anything in their mutual glance but
the grisly spectacle before
poor fellow poor young fellow this ought
be a lesson to grave robbers
potter ll hang for this if
catch him this was the drift of

and looked around him with a pathetic
in his eyes he
injun joe and exclaimed oh injun joe

potter would have fallen if they had
caught him and eased him
the ground then he said something told
t if i didn t come
nerveless hand with a vanquished
and said tell em joe
em it ain t any use any
staring and heard the stony hearted
reel off his serene statement they expecting
moment that the clear sky would deliver

was delayed and when he had finished
still stood alive and
for plainly this miscreant had
himself to satan and it would
of such a power
that why didn t you
what did you want to come

t seem to come anywhere but
and he fell to sobbing again
joe repeated his statement just
calmly a few minutes afterward on
inquest under oath and
withheld were confirmed in
belief that joe had sold himself

not take their fascinated eyes from his
they inwardly resolved to watch
nights when opportunity should offer
of his dread master injun
of the murdered man and put it
a wagon for removal and
wound bled a little the
thought that this happy circumstance would turn
in the right direction but
muff potter when it done it

this and at breakfast one morning
said tom you pitch around and talk
your sleep so much that
time tom blanched and dropped his
polly gravely what you

new enterprises he noticed too that

heart plainly here were
souls with but a single thought
wiping his eyes with his
that joe would not forget him but
had just been going to
of tom and had come to
mother had whipped him
drinking some cream which he
never tasted and knew nothing
it was plain that she was tired
him and wished him
was nothing for him to do
succumb he hoped she would
happy and never regret having driven her
boy out into the
as the two boys walked
compact to stand by each other and
brothers and never separate till death
began to lay their plans
crusts in a remote cave and dying
time of cold and want and
he consented to be a pirate three
below st petersburg at
point where the mississippi river was a
a long narrow wooded island with a
bar at the head of
and this offered well as a
abreast a dense and
a matter that did not occur to
then they hunted up huckleberry finn and
joined them promptly for all
were one to him he
indifferent they presently separated to meet
a lonely spot on the
bank two miles above the
at the favorite hour which was midnight
was a small log raft there which
meant to capture each would bring hooks
lines and such provision
most dark and mysterious way as became
and before the afternoon
done they had all
of spreading the fact
were cautioned to be mum and wait
midnight tom arrived with
trifles and stopped in a dense
on a small bluff overlooking the
mighty river lay like an ocean
rest tom listened a moment but no
a low distinct whistle
was answered from under
bluff tom whistled twice
these signals were answered in the same
who goes there tom sawyer the
avenger of the spanish main name your
tom had furnished these titles from
favorite literature tis well give the countersign
word simultaneously to the
night blood then tom tumbled
but it lacked the advantages
difficulty and danger so

also brought a few corn cobs to
pipes with but none

themselves to a chunk they made an
adventure of it saying hist every now
then and suddenly halting with finger on
moving with hands on imaginary dagger
and giving orders in dismal whispers that

their conducting this thing in an unpiratical
command huck at the after oar and
browed and with folded arms and gave

drove the raft toward mid stream it

drew beyond the middle
head right and then lay
their oars the river was
high so there was
current hardly a word was said during
next three quarters of an hour
the raft was passing before
could see him now abroad on the
sea facing peril and
doom with a grim
on his lips it was but a
remove jackson s island beyond eyeshot of
village and so he looked
last with a broken and satisfied heart
other pirates were looking their last
and they all looked so long
they came near letting the
drift them out of the range of
the bar two hundred
they waded back and
freight part of the little raft s
the bushes for a tent to shelter
provisions but they themselves would sleep
the open air in good weather as
or thirty steps within the
bacon in the frying pan
corn pone stock they had brought
wild free way in
and uninhabited island far from
haunts of men and they said
fire lit up their faces and
its ruddy glare upon the pillared tree
of their forest temple and upon the
foliage and festooning vines when the
crisp slice of bacon was gone and
last allowance of corn pone devoured the

deny themselves such a romantic feature as
roasting camp fire ain t it
say if they could see us say
they d just die to be here
hucky i reckon so
huckleberry anyways i m suited i don

you don t have

but i hadn t

well you would be
nice old slouch of a hermit you
finished gouging out a cob and now
fitted a weed stem
a coal to the charge and blowing
cloud of fragrant smoke he was in
full bloom of luxurious contentment the other
envied him this majestic vice and
resolved to acquire it
presently huck said what does pirates
a bully time take ships and burn
and get the money and bury it
awful places in their
things to watch it and kill everybody
to the island said joe they don
and the women s
beautiful too and don t they wear
bulliest clothes oh no all gold and
enthusiasm who said huck why the pirates
i ain t dressed
for a pirate said
with a regretful pathos in his
but i ain t got none
after they should have begun their adventures
was customary for wealthy pirates to
with a proper wardrobe
pipe dropped from the fingers
the red handed and he
the sleep of the
free and the weary
terror of the seas
spanish main had more
in getting to sleep they said
prayers inwardly and lying
since there was nobody there
aloud in truth they had a
not to say them at all but
were afraid to proceed to
at once they reached and hovered
the imminent verge of sleep but an
it was conscience they began to feel
vague fear that they had been doing
to run away and next they thought
real torture came they tried to argue
away by reminding conscience that they had
plausibilities it seemed to them in the
that there was no getting around the
hooking while taking bacon
the bible so they inwardly
that so long as they remained in
business their piracies should
tom awoke in the morning
wondered where he was
sat up and rubbed his eyes and
a delicious sense of
and peace in the deep pervading calm
silence of the woods
a leaf stirred not a sound obtruded
great nature s meditation beaded
stood upon the leaves and grasses
white layer of ashes covered the
and a thin blue
of smoke rose straight into the
joe and huck still slept now
away in the woods a bird called
a woodpecker was heard gradually the
dim gray of the morning
and as gradually sounds multiplied
life manifested itself the marvel of nature
to the musing boy a little
into the air from
to time and sniffing
then proceeding again for he was
tom said and when the worm approached
his hopes rising and falling
turns as the creature still came
him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere
when at last it
a painful moment with its
body in the air and
came decisively down upon
s leg and began a journey
him his whole heart
glad for that meant that he was
to have a new suit
clothes without the shadow of a doubt
gaudy piratical uniform now
procession of ants appeared from
in particular and went about
labors one struggled manfully by
a dead spider five times as
as itself in its
a tree trunk a brown spotted lady
climbed the dizzy height of a
blade and tom bent
close to it and said lady bug
bug fly away home
house is on fire
practised upon its simplicity more than once
at its ball and tom touched the
its body and pretend to be
the birds were fairly rioting by this
head and trilled out her
then a shrill jay
down a flash of blue flame
his head to one
consuming curiosity a gray squirrel
a big fellow of the
up at intervals to
and chatter at the boys for the
things had probably never seen a
being before and scarcely
whether to be afraid or not all
was wide awake and stirring now
the dense foliage far
came fluttering upon the scene
shout and in a
and tumbling over each other in
sandbar they felt no longing
beyond the majestic waste of
but this only gratified them since its
was something like burning the
camp wonderfully refreshed glad
and ravenous and they
found a spring of
hickory leaves and felt
was slicing bacon for breakfast tom and
asked him to hold
a minute they stepped to a promising
in the river bank and threw
their lines almost immediately
had reward joe had not
again with some handsome bass
couple of sun perch
for quite a family they fried
fish with the bacon and
astonished for no fish had ever
know that the quicker
air exercise bathing and a large ingredient
hunger make too they lay
in the shade after
off through the woods on an exploring
decaying logs through tangled
among solemn monarchs of the
hung from their crowns to
grape vines now and then
came upon snug nooks
with grass and jeweled with flowers they
plenty of things to be
about three miles long and a
of a mile wide and
only separated from it by
hour so it was close upon the
to camp they were too hungry to
to fish but they fared sumptuously
themselves down in the
to talk but the talk soon
woods and the sense of
began to tell upon the
undefined longing crept upon them
took dim shape presently it was budding
even finn the red handed was
of his doorsteps and empty
but they were all ashamed of their
his thought for some time
the boys had been
in the distance just as one sometimes
of the ticking of
of but now this mysterious
became more pronounced and forced a
the boys started glanced at each
attitude there was a long silence
is it exclaimed joe
thunder said huckleberry in an
feet and hurried to the
toward the town they parted the bushes
the bank and peered out over the
the little steam ferryboat was about a
below the village drifting with
current her broad deck seemed crowded
with the stream in
neighborhood of the ferryboat but the boys
not determine what the men
them were doing presently
great jet of white smoke burst from
ferryboat s side and
lazy cloud that same dull throb
last summer when bill turner
drownded they shoot a cannon over the
and that makes him come
they ll float right there and
joe i wonder what
the bread do that oh
what they say over it before they
it out but they don t say
s funny said tom but
they say it to themselves of
the other boys agreed that there was
in what tom said because an ignorant
of bread uninstructed by
incantation could not be expected to act
intelligently when set upon an
of such gravity by
now said joe i do too said
know who it is the boys
listened and watched presently a revealing thought
through tom s mind and he
boys i know who s drownded it
in an instant here was
hearts were breaking on
account tears were being shed accusing memories
unkindness to these poor lost lads
rising up and unavailing regrets
remorse were being indulged and best of
the envy of all the boys as
as this dazzling notoriety
concerned this was fine
was worth while to be a
on the ferryboat went back to her
business and the skiffs disappeared the
returned to camp they
and the illustrious trouble they were making
then fell to guessing at what the
was thinking and saying about them and
pictures they drew of the
distress on their account were gratifying
when the shadows of night closed them
they gradually ceased to talk and sat
into the fire with their minds
certain persons at home who
not enjoying this fine frolic as
grew troubled and unhappy a sigh
two escaped unawares by and
joe timidly ventured upon a roundabout feeler
to how the others might
upon a return to
derision huck being uncommitted as
quickly explained and was glad to get
of the scrape with as little
effectually laid to rest for the moment
the night deepened huck
snore joe followed next
lay upon his elbow
for some time watching the two intently
and went searching among the grass and
something upon each of these
rolled up and put in his jacket
and the other he
in joe s hat and removed
to a little distance
the owner and he also
among the trees till
straightway broke into a keen
sandbar chapter xv a few minutes later
wading toward the illinois shore
the depth reached his middle
along till he found a
place and drew himself
he put his hand on
safe and then struck through the
garments shortly before ten
clock he came out into an
high bank everything was quiet under
his eyes slipped into the
into the skiff that did yawl
waited panting presently the cracked bell
and a voice gave
order to cast off a minute or
later the skiff s
was standing high up
the boat s swell and the
in his success for he knew it
a long twelve or
minutes the wheels stopped and tom slipped
alleys and shortly found
at his aunt s
sitting room window for a light
crack he continued pushing cautiously and
every time it creaked till he judged
might squeeze through on his knees
he put his head through and began
things now go long and shut
time he lay and breathed himself for
time and then crept
where he could almost touch
aunt s foot but
i was saying said aunt
he warn t bad
just giddy and harum
responsible than a colt he
the best hearted boy that ever was
with my joe always full of his
and up to every
as unselfish and kind as
could be and laws bless me to
i went and whipped him for
that cream never once recollecting that
to see him again in
mrs harper sobbed as if her heart
break i hope tom
better off where he is said sid
if he d been better
the glare of the old
s eye though he could
tom now that he
gone god ll take care of him
you trouble yourself sir oh
give him up he was such
comfort to me although he tormented my
heart out of me
but it s so hard oh
s so hard only
saturday my joe busted a firecracker
under my nose and i
him sprawling little did
know then how soon oh if it
to do over again i d
it yes yes yes i know
how you feel mrs harper i
just exactly how you
no longer ago than yesterday noon my
full of pain killer and i did
the cretur would tear
house down and god forgive
poor boy poor dead boy but
s out of all his
now and the last words i ever
him say was to reproach
this memory was too much
tom was snuffling now himself and
in pity of himself than anybody else
from time to time
he was sufficiently touched by his aunt
grief to long to rush
from under the bed and overwhelm her
joy and the theatrical gorgeousness of the
too but he resisted and lay
he went on listening and gathered by
that the boys had got drowned while
said the missing lads had promised
soon the wise heads had put this
had gone off on that
town below presently but toward noon
raft had been found lodged against the
shore some five or
believed that the search
the bodies had been a fruitless effort
good swimmers would otherwise
over and the funerals
be preached on that morning tom shuddered
with a mutual impulse
two bereaved women flung themselves into
other s arms and had
good consoling cry and then
aunt polly was tender far beyond
wont in her good night
sid and mary sid
down and prayed for
love in her words and her old
she went to bed
she kept making broken
ejaculations from time to
her his heart was full
and he lingered considering
face lighted with a happy
the bark hastily in
pocket then he bent over
kissed the faded lips
behind him he threaded his way back
the boat for he knew she
skiff at the stern slipped into it
was soon rowing cautiously upstream
he had pulled a mile
this was a familiar bit of work
him he was moved to
the skiff arguing that it might
considered a ship and therefore legitimate prey
a pirate but he knew a
search would be made for it and
might end in revelations
he stepped ashore and entered the
rest torturing himself meanwhile to keep awake
stretch the night was far spent
fairly abreast the island
he rested again until the sun
well up and gilding
great river with its
stream a little later he paused
upon the threshold of
camp and heard joe say
tom s true blue huck and he
a disgrace to a pirate
other now i wonder
well the things is
anyway ain t they
near but not yet
t back here to breakfast which he
exclaimed tom with fine
effect stepping grandly into camp
fish was shortly provided
as the boys set to work
it tom recounted and adorned his
chapter xvi after dinner all
on the bar they went about
sticks into the sand
when they found a
place they went down
their knees and dug
their hands sometimes they would take
or sixty eggs out of one hole
were perfectly round white things a
smaller than an english walnut they had
famous fried egg feast
night and another on friday morning after
bar and chased each other round and
shedding clothes as they went until
far away up the
water of the bar
the stiff current which
tripped their legs from under them from
faces with their palms
approaching each other with averted
to avoid the strangling sprays and
gripping and struggling till the
man ducked his neighbor
a tangle of white legs and
one and the same time when they
well exhausted they would run out and
on the dry hot sand and lie
it and by and by
for the water again and go
to them that their naked skin represented
colored tights very fairly so they drew
ring in the sand and had a
with three clowns in it for none
next they got their marbles and
knucks and ring taw
keeps till that amusement grew stale
joe and huck had another swim
tom would not venture because he
that in kicking off his trousers he
kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles
his ankle and he wondered how
had escaped cramp so
until he had found it
and ready to rest they gradually
fell to gazing longingly across the wide
toe he scratched it out and
angry with himself for
weakness but he wrote it again nevertheless
could not help it he erased
once more and then
himself out of temptation
driving the other boys together
so homesick that he could
endure the misery of it the
but tried hard not to show it
was not ready to tell yet
if this mutinous depression was not
out he said with a great show
cheerfulness i bet there s been pirates
how d you feel to light
a rotten chest full of gold and
hey but it roused only faint enthusiasm
tom tried one or
boys let s give it
ll feel better by and by said
just think of the fishing
i want to go home
joe there ain t such another
place anywhere swimming s
good i don t
to care for it somehow when
ain t anybody to say
sha n t go in i
to go home oh shucks
want to see my mother and you
too if you had one
ain t any more baby than you
let the cry baby go home
thing does it want to
its mother and so it
you like it here don t
said y e s without any heart
as i live said joe
moodily away and began to
to go long home and get laughed
oh you re a nice pirate huck
can get along without
per aps but tom was
nevertheless and was alarmed to see joe
sullenly on with his dressing
joe s preparations so wistfully and
up such an ominous silence presently without
tom s heart began
not bear the look and
let s us go too tom
won t you can
s hendering you huck
tom i wisht you d come
now you think it over we
wait for you when
heart to yield his pride and
along too he hoped the boys would
it suddenly dawned on tom
it was become very lonely and
his pride and then darted
his comrades yelling wait wait
want to tell you something they
stopped and turned around
moodily till at last they
the point he was driving at and
they set up a war whoop of
and said it was splendid and
if he had told
but his real reason had been
fear that not even the secret would
of time and so he had
back and went at their sports
the genius of it after a dainty
and fish dinner tom said he wanted
the idea and said
would like to try too so
made pipes and filled them these
cigars made of grape vine and they
the tongue and were not considered
anyway now they stretched themselves
slender confidence the smoke had
a little but tom said
d a learnt long ago so
just nothing why many a time
ve looked at people smoking and thought
i wish i could do that
i never thought i could said tom
s just the way with me hain
t you huck i
well i have too said tom
you remember huck bob tanner was there
said it don t you remember
s so said huck
was the day after
said tom huck recollects it i
i could smoke this
i could smoke it all
thatcher couldn t jeff thatcher
with two draws just
him try it once he d
i bet he would and
johnny miller tackle it
bet you johnny miller couldn
any more do this than
just one little snifter
fetch him deed it would joe
i wish the boys could
boys don t say anything about it
some time when they re around i
come up to you and say joe

you ll say kind of careless like
say yes i got
old pipe and another
and i ll say oh that
all right if it s strong
pipes and we ll light up
as ca m and then just see
look by jings that ll
gay tom i wish it was now
the talk ran on but presently
began to flag a trifle and
marvellously increased every pore inside the
cheeks became a spouting fountain
could scarcely bail out the cellars
inundation little overflowings down their throats
in spite of all
could do and sudden
s followed both fountains were going
main joe said feebly
better go and find it
said with quivering lips and halting
it so huck sat down again and
it lonesome and went to find
woods both very pale both
they had had any trouble
had got rid of it they were
talkative at supper that
they had a humble look and
prepare theirs they said
they were not feeling very well
them about midnight joe awoke and called
bode something the boys
waiting the solemn hush continued
was swallowed up in the blackness
the foliage for a moment and
vanished by and by
a faint moan came sighing through
branches of the forest and
boys felt a fleeting
upon their cheeks and shuddered
the fancy that the spirit
a pause now a weird flash turned
into day and showed every
grass blade separate and distinct that
white startled faces too a deep peal
the heavens and lost itself in sullen
air passed by rustling all the leaves
snowing the flaky ashes broadcast
the fire another fierce
tops right over the boys heads
clung together in terror
exclaimed tom they sprang away stumbling
roots and among vines
the dark no two plunging
the same direction a furious blast roared
the trees making everything sing
it went one blinding flash after
came and peal on
of deafening thunder and now a drenching
poured down and the rising hurricane
it in sheets along the ground
booming thunder blasts drowned their
utterly however one by one they
in at last and took shelter under
furiously even if the other
would have allowed them the tempest
higher and higher and
and went winging away on the
fled with many tumblings and bruises to
the river bank now the
was at its highest under the
conflagration of lightning that flamed in
skies everything below stood out
trees the billowy river
with foam the driving spray of
flakes the dim outlines
through the drifting cloud rack and the
veil of rain every little
crashing through the younger growth and
unflagging thunder peals came
in ear splitting explosive bursts
and sharp and unspeakably appalling
effort that seemed likely to tear
island to pieces burn it
drown it to the tree
blow it away and deafen every
in it all at
a wild night for homeless
heads to be out
but at last the battle
done and the forces
deal awed but they
there was still something to
thankful for because the great sycamore the
of their beds was a ruin now
were not under it
the catastrophe happened everything in
was drenched the camp fire
their generation and had made no
against rain here was matter
dismay for they were soaked through and
curved upward and separated itself from the
that a handbreadth or so of
had escaped wetting so they
on great dead boughs
they had a roaring furnace and were
ham and had a
adventure until morning for there was
the boys drowsiness came over them and
went out on the sandbar and lay
to sleep they got scorched out
and by and drearily set about getting
pirates as well as he could
they cared nothing for marbles or circus
swimming or anything he reminded them
of cheer while it lasted he got
was to knock off being pirates
they were attracted by this idea
with black mud like
of course and then they went tearing
upon each other from
with dreadful war whoops and killed
a gory day consequently it was an
satisfactory one they assembled in
a difficulty arose hostile
could not break the bread of
together without first making peace and this
a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe
of the savages almost wished they
in due form and
they were glad they had
something they found that they
they did not get sick enough
be seriously uncomfortable they
not likely to fool away this
cautiously after supper with right fair success
so they spent a jubilant
they were prouder and happier in
new acquirement than they
we will leave them to
and chatter and brag since we
in the little town
same tranquil saturday afternoon the
and aunt polly s family were
grief and many tears an unusual quiet
the village although it was
quiet enough in all
an absent air and
little but they sighed often
to the children they had no
becky thatcher found herself moping about the
schoolhouse yard and feeling
comfort her she soliloquized oh if
only had a brass
knob again but i
little sob presently she stopped
said to herself it was right here
if it was to do
again i wouldn t say
i wouldn t say
for the whole world but
s gone now i ll never
never see him any more this
broke her down and
over the paling fence and talking in
the last time they saw
as they could easily see now and
lost lads stood at the
and then added something like and
was a standing just
just as i am
and as if you was him
was as close as that and he
just this way and then
seemed to go all over me like
you know and i never thought what
meant of course but i can
now then there was
dispute about who saw the dead
distinction and offered evidences more or
and when it was ultimately decided who
the last words with them
lucky parties took upon themselves a
of sacred importance and were gaped at
who had no other
in the remembrance well tom
he licked me once but
of the boys could
that and so that cheapened
heroes in awed voices when
next morning the bell
usual way it was a very
sabbath and the mournful sound seemed in
with the musing hush
began to gather loitering a moment in
vestibule to converse in whispers about
sad event but there
funereal rustling of dresses as the women
none could remember when the
church had been so full before
was finally a waiting
an expectant dumbness and then
polly entered followed by sid
family all in deep black and
whole congregation the old minister
well rose reverently and stood until
mourners were seated in the front pew
was another communing silence broken at
spread his hands abroad
prayed a moving hymn was sung and
ways and the rare promise
the lost lads that every
pictures felt a pang in remembering that
incident in the lives of
departed too which illustrated their sweet
natures and the people
easily see now how noble
had seemed rank rascalities well deserving
the cowhide the congregation became more
more moved as the pathetic
went on till at last the
his feelings and crying
the pulpit there was a rustle
moment later the church door
the minister raised his streaming eyes
his handkerchief and stood transfixed
ruin of drooping rags sneaking sheepishly in
rear they had been hid in
unused gallery listening to
and the harpers threw themselves upon their
knowing exactly what to do or where
and started to slink away but tom
s got to be glad to
and the loving attentions aunt polly
upon him were the one thing capable
making him more uncomfortable than
was before suddenly the minister shouted
the top of his voice praise
from whom all blessings flow sing
did old hundred swelled up
shook the rafters tom sawyer the pirate
around upon the envying juveniles
him and confessed in his heart that
his life as the sold congregation
out they said they would almost
tom got more cuffs and kisses that
a year and he hardly knew which
the most gratefulness to
and affection for himself chapter
that was tom s
with his brother pirates
attend their own funerals they
paddled over to the missouri shore on
log at dusk on saturday landing
slept in the woods at the
of the town till nearly
and had then crept
finished their sleep in the
of the church among a chaos
invalided benches at breakfast monday
aunt polly and mary were very
to tom and very attentive to
wants there was an unusual amount of
in the course of it aunt
said well i don t say

long enough the children left for school
the old lady to call on mrs
and vanquish her realism with tom s
dream sid had better judgment
to utter the thought that was in
mind as he left
skipping and prancing but
with a dignified swagger as became
was on him and
it was he tried not
seem to see the looks or
the remarks as he
him smaller boys than himself
to be seen with
and tolerated by him
if he had been the drummer at
head of a procession or
of his own size pretended
to know he had
away at all but they were
with envy nevertheless they would have given
to have that swarthy suntanned skin of
not have parted with either for a
at school the children
so much of him
from their eyes that the
only began it was
a thing likely to
when they got out
pipes and went serenely puffing around the
tom decided that he could be independent
becky thatcher now glory was
was distinguished maybe she
see that he could be as
as some other people presently she
tom pretended not to see
he moved away and joined a
of boys and girls
with flushed face and dancing eyes
to be busy chasing
she always made her captures in his
direction at such times too
gratified all the vicious
and made him the
disturbed and uneasy at
she tried to go away but her
were treacherous and carried her to
group instead she said to a girl
at tom s elbow with sham vivacity

on the island and how
lightning tore the great sycamore
all to flinders while he was
within three feet of it oh may
hands till all the
tom and amy then tom turned
away still talking and took amy
him becky s lips trembled and the
hid these signs with a forced
and went on chattering but the
had gone out of
picnic now and out of
as she could and hid herself and
wounded pride till the bell rang
roused up now with
gave her plaited tails a shake and
she knew what she d do at
amy with jubilant self satisfaction and
kept drifting about to find becky and
her with the performance at last he
falling of his mercury
was sitting cosily on a little bench
the schoolhouse looking at
heads so close together
the book that they did not seem
offered for a reconciliation he
himself a fool and all the hard
he could think of
wanted to cry with vexation amy
was singing but tom s tongue had
its function he did not
as otherwise he kept drifting to the
of the schoolhouse again and again
it maddened him to see as he
he saw that becky thatcher never once
that he was even
as she had suffered amy s happy
became intolerable tom hinted at
must be done and time was
but in vain the girl
on tom thought oh hang her
must be attending to those
and he hastened away hating
for it any other boy tom thought
his teeth any boy in the
fine and is aristocracy oh
first day you ever saw this
mister and i ll
you again you just wait till
catch you out i
just take and and he
gouging oh you do
the imaginary flogging was finished to
conscience could not endure
bear no more of
other distress becky resumed
picture inspections with alfred but as the
her triumph began to cloud and
lost interest gravity and absent
times she pricked up her ear at
footstep but it was a
hope no tom came at last she
her he did not
how kept exclaiming oh
last and said oh don
bother me i don
dropped alongside and was
to try to comfort her but she
go away and leave
alone can t you i hate you
the boy halted wondering what
could have done for she had
went musing into the
schoolhouse he was humiliated and angry
easily guessed his way to the
of him to vent her spite
tom sawyer he was far from
tom the less when this thought
his eye here was his opportunity
gratefully opened to the lesson
discovering herself she started homeward
tom would be thankful
their troubles would be healed before
was half way home however
had changed her mind
her when she was
about her picnic came scorching back
filled her with shame she resolved
let him get whipped on

that he had brought his

xx there was something
that swept away his low spirits

had the luck of coming upon
thatcher at the head of meadow
and said i acted mighty mean
day becky and i m
sorry i won t ever ever
as ever i live please make
looked him scornfully in the face
ll thank you to keep
to yourself mr thomas sawyer i
never speak to you again
the right time to say
into the schoolyard wishing she
a boy and imagining
he would trounce her if
were he presently encountered her and
a stinging remark as
passed she hurled one in
for school to take in
was so impatient to
she had had any lingering notion
driven it entirely away poor
she did not know how fast she
nearing trouble herself the
with an unsatisfied ambition the
of his desires was to be
doctor but poverty had decreed that he
be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster
day he took a mysterious
out of his desk
absorbed himself in it at
when no classes were reciting he
was not an urchin in school but
perishing to have a glimpse of
but the chance never came
boy and girl had a
which stood near the door she
it was a precious
she glanced around found herself alone
the next instant she had
somebody s anatomy carried no information to
mind so she began to
once upon a handsomely engraved
colored frontispiece a human figure stark naked
and tom sawyer stepped in at
door and caught a glimpse of the
to close it and had the
luck to tear the pictured page half
the middle she thrust the
into the desk turned the key
person and look at what they re
at how could i know you was
at anything you ought to be ashamed
what shall i do what shall i
i ll be whipped and i
was whipped in school
she stamped her little foot
you want to i know something
you ll see hateful hateful
and she flung out of the
with a new explosion
flustered by this onslaught presently he said
fool a girl is never
a girl they re so thin skinned
chicken hearted well of
because there s other ways of getting
on her that ain t so
was tore his book nobody
answer then he ll do just
way he always does ask first one
then t other and when he
to the right girl he
them they ain t got any backbone
of a tight place for
thatcher because there ain t any
a moment longer and then
all right though she d like
a fix let her sweat it out
joined the mob of
in tom did not feel a
interest in his studies every
he stole a glance at the girls
of the room becky s face troubled
pity her and yet it was
he could do to help it
was really worthy the
presently the spelling book
was made and tom s mind was
full of his own matters
his trouble by denying that
book himself and she was
the denial only seemed to make the
worse for tom becky supposed she
be glad of that and she tried
certain when the worst
get up and tell on alfred
but she made an effort and forced
she to herself he ll
about me tearing the picture sure
wouldn t say a
whipping and went back to
seat not at all broken hearted for
thought it was possible that he
unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling
himself in some skylarking
he had denied it for form
whole hour drifted by the
sat nodding in his throne
his desk and reached
his book but seemed
whether to take it out
leave it most of the pupils
up languidly but there were two among
his chair to read tom
a glance at becky he
seen a hunted and
rabbit look as she did with
gun levelled at its
instantly he forgot his quarrel with
quick something must be done done
of the emergency paralyzed his invention good
had an inspiration he
run and snatch the book
through the door and fly but his
volume if tom only had the wasted
back again too late
was no help for
was that in it
smote even the innocent with fear there
silence while one might count
the master was gathering his wrath
there was not a sound
could have heard a
rogers did you tear this book a
another pause joseph harper did you
more and more intense under
slow torture of these proceedings the
then turned to the girls amy
a shake of the head gracie
do this another negative
next girl was becky
tom was trembling from head
sense of the hopelessness of
it was white with
thought shot like lightning through tom s
he sprang to his feet
shouted i done it the
stared in perplexity at this incredible folly
stood a moment to gather his dismembered
go to his punishment the
out of poor becky s
received with indifference the
cruelty of a command
remain two hours after
should be dismissed for he
who would wait for him outside till
the tedious time as loss either tom
vengeance against alfred temple for with
own treachery but even the longing
vengeance had to give way soon
pleasanter musings and he
asleep at last with becky
latest words lingering dreamily in his ear
how could you be so noble
xxi vacation was approaching
schoolmaster always severe grew severer and
to make a good
on examination day his
idle now at least among the smaller
escaped lashing mr dobbins lashings were very
ones too for although
carried under his wig a perfectly bald
shiny head he had only reached
the great day approached all the tyranny
was in him came
the surface he seemed to take
vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings
their days in terror and suffering
their nights in plotting revenge they threw
no opportunity to do the
all the time the
boys always retired from the field
in the sign painter s
master boarded in his
s family and had
in a few days and there would
nothing to interfere with the plan the
always prepared himself for
occasions by getting pretty
fuddled and the sign painter s
said that when the dominie
reached the proper condition
the thing while he
and hurried away to school in the
of time the interesting occasion arrived at
in the evening the schoolhouse was
lighted and adorned with
the master sat throned in his
looking tolerably mellow three rows of
rows in front of
platform upon which were seated the scholars
of the evening rows of small
of girls and young ladies clad in
and muslin and conspicuously
trinkets their bits of
hair all the rest
the house was filled with non participating
the exercises began a
to speak in public on the
etc accompanying himself with
machine might have used
the machine to be a trifle out
though cruelly scared and got
made his manufactured bow
retired a little shamefaced
lisped mary had a
lamb etc performed a
confidence and soared into the unquenchable
indestructible give me liberty
frantic gesticulation and broke down in the
was like to choke true
had the manifest sympathy of the house
which was even worse than its sympathy
defeated there was a weak attempt at
but it died early the boy
also the assyrian came down and other
gems then there were reading
and a spelling fight the
latin class recited with honor the
now original compositions by

dainty ribbon and proceeded
read with labored attention

ancestors in the female line
back to the crusades friendship was

government compared and contrasted melancholy
in these compositions was a nursed
was a tendency to lug in
phrases until they were

at the end of each
every one of them no
effort was made to squirm it into
aspect or other that the
not sufficient to compass
banishment of the fashion from
schools and it is not sufficient to
it never will be sufficient while
world stands perhaps there
no school in all our land where
of the most frivolous and the
religious girl in the school is always
but enough of this homely truth
first composition that was read was one
is this then life perhaps the reader

tinted pictures of joy in fancy the
throng the observed of all observers
is whirling through the mazes of
gay assembly in such delicious
time quickly glides by and the welcome
dreams how fairy like does everything
scene is more charming than the
finds that beneath this goodly exterior
is vanity the flattery which once
her soul now grates harshly upon
heart she turns away with
conviction that earthly pleasures cannot

gratification from time to time
with a peculiarly afflicting
the applause was enthusiastic then arose
interesting paleness that comes of pills and

near tallapoosa s stream have

the poem was very satisfactory nevertheless
assumed a tragic expression and began to
dark and tempestuous was night around

but the deep intonations of
the terrific lightning revelled in
boisterous winds unanimously came forth
if to enhance by their
at such a time
instead thereof my dearest friend my counsellor
those bright beings pictured in the
by her own transcendent loveliness so
was her step it failed to
even a sound and but
the magical thrill imparted
her genial touch as other unobtrusive
she would have glided away un perceived
some ten pages of manuscript and
destructive of all hope to non
that it took the first
this composition was considered
be the very finest effort of
evening the mayor of the village in
a warm speech in which he
that it was by far the most
thing he had ever listened
and that daniel webster
it may be remarked
experience referred to as life
page was up to
almost to the verge of
to draw a map
america on the blackboard to
unsteady hand and a smothered titter
over the house he knew what the
was and set himself
right it he sponged out lines
distorted them more than ever and the
was more pronounced he threw
if determined not to be put
by the mirth he
that all eyes were
upon him he imagined he was
and yet the tittering continued it even
increased and well it might there was
over his head and
cat suspended around the haunches
a string she had a rag tied
her head and jaws to keep
from mewing as she slowly descended
curved upward and clawed
clawed at the intangible air
tittering rose higher and higher
cat was within six inches of the
wig with her desperate claws clung to
and was snatched up
the garret in an instant
her trophy still in her possession
how the light did blaze abroad
the master s bald
it that broke up
vacation had come note the pretended
quoted in this chapter are taken without
but they are exactly
precisely after the schoolgirl pattern and
imitations could be chapter xxii tom joined
from smoking chewing and
as long as he
do a thing is the surest way
the world to make a
want to go and do
very thing tom soon found
tormented with a desire
so intense that nothing but the hope
a chance to display himself in his
but he soon gave
hopes upon old judge frazer
of the peace who was apparently on
deathbed and would have a big
an official during three days tom was
for news of it sometimes
would venture to get
his regalia and practise before the
glass but the judge had a
convalescent tom was disgusted
felt a sense of
too he handed in his resignation at
and that night the judge
a relapse and died
free boy again however
was something in that he
drink and swear now but
want to the simple fact that he
took the desire away and the
of it tom presently wondered to
that his coveted vacation was
to hang a little heavily on his
three days and so he abandoned
the first of all the negro
a sensation tom and joe harper
days even the glorious fourth
in some sense a failure for it
hard there was no procession
consequence and the greatest man in the
as tom supposed mr benton
actual united states senator proved an overwhelming
for he was not twenty
feet high nor even anywhere
boys played circus for three
rag carpeting admission three pins for
two for girls and then
was abandoned a phrenologist and a mesmerizer
and went again and left the
duller and drearier than ever there were
they only made the aching
between ache the harder becky
was gone to her constantinople
to stay with her parents during
so there was no bright side to
a chronic misery it was
two long weeks tom lay a prisoner
very ill he was interested in nothing
he got upon his feet
every creature there had been a
crossed him everywhere he found joe harper
a testament and turned sadly away
the depressing spectacle he sought ben
and found him visiting the poor
hunted up jim hollis who
his attention to the precious blessing
his late measles as a
every boy he encountered
another ton to his depression and
broke and he crept home
all the town was
forever and forever and that night
blinding sheets of lightning
bedclothes and waited in
horror of suspense for his
him he believed he
taxed the forbearance of the powers above
the extremity of endurance
a waste of pomp
ammunition to kill a bug with
battery of artillery but there seemed
incongruous about the getting up
an expensive thunderstorm as
the tempest spent itself
boy s first impulse was
be grateful and reform his second
to wait for there
relapsed the three weeks
spent on his back this time seemed
at last he was hardly grateful that
had been spared remembering
forlorn he was he drifted listlessly down
acting as judge in a
court that was trying a cat
tom had suffered a relapse chapter
came on in the court
it every reference to the murder
a shudder to his heart
his troubled conscience and
were put forth in his
he could be suspected of knowing
about the murder but still
could not be comfortable in the
of this gossip it kept him in
would be some relief
while to divide his
moreover he wanted to assure himself
t never a word
you ask well i was
why tom sawyer we
t be alive two days if that
found out you know that
pause huck they couldn t anybody
you to tell could they get
wanted that half breed devil to
me they could get me

country and they wonder
wasn t ever hung before yes they
like that all the time i ve
do it too the
had a long talk but it
them little comfort as the twilight drew
perhaps with an undefined
clear away their difficulties
luckless captive the boys
was on the ground floor
there were no guards his gratitude
their gifts had always
deeper than ever this time
felt cowardly and treacherous to the last
when potter said you ve
mighty good to me boys better n
else in this town and i
t forget it i don t
i says to myself says i i
befriend em what i
they don t forget him says
and i don t forget

west so that s it
s a prime comfort to see faces

friendly faces git up on one
the bars but mine s
big little hands and
but they ve helped
help him more if they could tom
home miserable and his dreams that night
full of horrors the next day and
in but forcing himself to
out huck was having the
experience they studiously avoided each other each
dismal fascination always brought them back presently
kept his ears open when idlers
closing more and more relentlessly around poor
the village talk was to the
that injun joe s evidence
to what the jury s verdict would
tom was out late that
and came to bed
the court house the next morning
this was to be the great day
sexes were about equally represented
and haggard timid and hopeless was brought
with chains upon him and seated
all the curious eyes could stare at
no less conspicuous was injun joe
as ever there was another pause and
the judge arrived and
the usual whisperings among the lawyers and
together of papers followed these details and
preparation that was as
as it was fascinating now a witness
called who testified that he found muff
washing in the brook at an
discovered and that he immediately sneaked away
some further questioning counsel
the prosecution said take the witness the
them again when his own counsel said
next witness proved the
ask him potter s lawyer
seen the knife in potter
declined to question him the faces of
s guilty behavior when brought
the scene of the murder they
that morning which all present remembered so
none of them were cross examined
for the prosecution now said
is above suspicion we
at the bar we rest our case
a groan escaped from poor potter and
put his face in
and fro while a painful
reigned in the court room many
s compassion testified itself in tears counsel
our remarks at the opening of this
we foreshadowed our purpose
prove that our client did this
of a blind and irresponsible delirium
by drink we have changed our mind
shall not offer that plea then to
clerk call thomas sawyer a puzzled amazement
upon the stand the boy looked wild
the oath was administered thomas sawyer
were you on the seventeenth of
injun joe s iron face
his tongue failed him the audience listened
into his voice to
the graveyard a little bit
please don t be
a contemptuous smile flitted across injun
how near were you
or not i was hid where behind
elms that s on
edge of the grave injun joe
yes sir i went there
your companion s name we will produce
at the proper time did you carry
there with you tom hesitated
looked confused speak out my boy don
be diffident the truth is
respectable what did you
there only a a dead cat there
a ripple of mirth which
court checked we will produce
skeleton of that cat now my boy
us everything that occurred tell it in
anything and don t be afraid
began hesitatingly at first
as he warmed to his subject
words flowed more and more
him with parted lips and bated
the audience hung upon his words
strain upon pent emotion reached its climax
the doctor fetched the
around and muff potter fell
joe jumped with the
half breed sprang for a window tore
more the pet of the old the
of the young his
even went into immortal print for the
that believed he would be
as usual the fickle unreasoning world took
lavishly as it had abused him before
tom s days were
of splendor and exultation to him
his nights were seasons
horror injun joe infested all his
for tom had told the
story to the lawyer
night before the great day of
saved him the suffering
testifying in court the poor
had got the attorney to
secrecy but what of
s house by night
lips that had been
huck s confidence in the human
was well nigh obliterated daily muff
spoken but nightly he wished he had
up his tongue half the time tom
afraid injun joe would never be captured
other half he was afraid
until that man was dead and
had been offered the
had been scoured but no injun
was found one of
up from st louis moused
shook his head looked wise
you can t hang
clew for murder and
desire to go somewhere
but failed of success next he sought
rogers he had gone fishing presently he
upon huck finn the red handed huck
answer tom took him to a private
confidentially huck was willing huck was
enterprise that offered entertainment
required no capital for he
oh most anywhere why is it hid

of our being afeard well

in the middle of the moonlit valley
them stood the ha nted
utterly isolated its fences gone long ago
weeds smothering the very
the chimney crumbled to ruin the
sashes vacant a corner
gazed awhile half expecting to
a blue light flit past
tone as befitted the time and
the right to give the haunted house
hill chapter xxvi about noon the next
the boys arrived at the dead tree
was measurably so also but suddenly
lookyhere tom do you know what
it is tom mentally ran over the
of the week and then quickly
his eyes with a
look in them my i
all at once it popped onto
that it was friday
it a body can
be too careful huck we might
such a thing on a friday
better say we would there s some
days maybe but friday ain

a rotten bad dream last night
about rats no sure sign of trouble

do is to look mighty sharp and
drop this thing for to day
huck no who s
hood why he was one of the
men that was ever in england
the best he was a robber
bishops and rich people and
and such like but
always divided up with em perfectly
well he must a been a
he could take his
bow and plug a
some kind of a bow
course and if he hit that dime
hood it s nobby
m agreed so they played robin hood
the afternoon now and then casting
yearning eye down upon the haunted house
passing a remark about the morrow
prospects and possibilities there as the sun
shadows of the trees and soon
cardiff hill on saturday shortly after
the boys were at the
and a chat in
little in their last hole
with great hope but merely because
said there were so many cases
people had given up a treasure after
somebody else had come along and turned
and went away feeling that they had
trifled with fortune but had fulfilled all
reigned there under the baking sun and
so depressing about the
and desolation of the
to venture in then they crept to
door and took a
peep they saw a weed grown floorless
staircase and here there
everywhere hung ragged and abandoned
they presently entered softly with quickened pulses
in whispers ears alert to catch the
sound and muscles tense
and interested examination rather admiring their own
and wondering at it too next they
to look up stairs
other and of course there could
but one result they
were the same signs of decay in
corner they found a closet
their courage was up now and
down and begin work when sh
tom what is it whispered
blanching with fright sh there hear it
t you budge they re coming
the floor with their eyes to knot
a misery of fear they
t whisper another word huck my goodness
this two men entered each boy said
himself there s the old deaf and
spaniard that s been about town once
twice lately never saw t other man
t other was a
unkempt creature with nothing
wrapped in a serape he had bushy
from under his sombrero and he wore
goggles when they came in t
was talking in a low voice
the door with their backs to
wall and the speaker continued
remarks his manner became less
and his words more
as he proceeded no
i don t like it it s
to the vast surprise
it was injun joe s there was
for some time then joe said what
any more dangerous than
s come of it that s different
up the river so and
be known that we tried anyway long
dangerous than coming here
the daytime anybody would
us that saw us i
that but there warn t any other
warn t any use trying to stir
of here with those infernal boys playing
there on the hill
was that they had remembered it
friday and concluded to
a luncheon after a long and
silence injun joe said look here
you go back up the
on dropping into this town
once more for a look we ll
texas we ll leg
s your turn to watch he
down in the weeds and soon
or twice and he
drew a long grateful breath
said i can t i d
if they was to wake
step he made wrung such a hideous
from the crazy floor that he sank
almost dead with fright
never made a second attempt the boys
there counting the dragging moments till
seemed to them that time must be
and eternity growing gray and then
last the sun was setting now one
smiled grimly upon his comrade
him up with his foot and said
you re a watchman
happened my have i been asleep oh
partly nearly time for
to be moving pard
t know leave it
as we ve always done
reckon no use to take
six hundred and fifty in
s something to carry
to come here once
no but i d say come
the night as we
to do it s better
but look here it
job accidents might happen tain
just regularly bury it and bury it
good idea said the comrade who
across the room knelt down
one of the rearward hearth
and took out a bag
for himself and as much for
joe and passed the bag to
latter who was on his knees
the corner now digging with
an instant with gloating eyes
watched every movement luck the splendor
six hundred dollars was money enough to
here was treasure hunting
simply meant oh but ain
you glad now we re here
s knife struck upon
here bear a hand and
ll see what it s here for
his hand in and drew it out
examined the handful of coins they were
as themselves and as delighted joe s
said we ll make quick
of this there s an old rusty
over amongst the weeds in the
the other side of the fireplace
ran and brought the boys pick
shovel injun joe took the pick
muttered something to himself and then
unearthed it was not
large it was iron bound and had
very strong before the
years had injured it the
contemplated the treasure awhile
blissful silence pard there
joe twas always said that murrel s
stranger observed i know it
it i should say now you
me least you don
know all about that thing tain
light flamed in his eyes
it s finished then texas go
to your nance and your kids
stand by till you hear from me
if you say so what ll
do with this bury
no by the great sachem no
sick with terror in a moment what
has a pick and a shovel
what business with fresh
what bury it again and leave
take it to my den why
course might have thought of
before you mean number one no number
under the cross the other place is
and went about from window
window cautiously peeping out presently he
stairs the boys breath forsook
injun joe put his
on his knife halted a
undecided and then turned
the stairway the boys thought of
closet but their strength was gone the
the intolerable distress of
spring for the closet when
was a crash of
timbers and injun joe landed on
his comrade said now what s the
of all that if it
them stay there who cares if they
to jump down now and get
trouble who objects it will
i m willing in my opinion whoever
those things in here caught a
ghosts or devils or something i
was left ought to be economized
getting things ready for
shortly afterward they slipped out
moved toward the river with their precious
tom and huck rose up weak but
chinks between the logs
the house follow not they they were
to reach ground again
broken necks and take
townward track over the
they did not talk much they
too much absorbed in
hidden the silver with the
up missing bitter bitter luck that the
were ever brought there
resolved to keep a lookout for that
out for chances to do his
ghastly thought occurred to tom
what if he means us
talked it all over and
somebody else at least
since only tom had
very very small comfort
was to tom to be
in danger company would be
palpable improvement he thought chapter xxvii
adventure of the day mightily
tom s dreams that night four
rich treasure and four times it wasted
and wakefulness brought back
as he lay in
his great adventure he noticed that they
curiously subdued and far away somewhat as
they had happened in another world or
favor of this idea namely that
quantity of coin he had seen
too vast to be real he
never seen as much as
and he was like all
of his age and
in life in that he imagined that
references to hundreds and thousands were
fanciful forms of speech
that no such sums really existed in
moment that so large a
found in actual money
any one s possession if his
of hidden treasure had been
they would have been
of real dimes and a bushel of
splendid ungraspable dollars but the incidents of
clearer under the attrition
thinking them over and so he
not have been a dream
all this uncertainty must be swept away
would snatch a hurried
and go and find
huck was sitting on the gunwale
concluded to let huck
up to the subject if he did
do it then the
would be proved to have been
a dream hello huck hello
silence for a minute tom
it awful tain t
somehow i most wish
it was i ve had dreams enough

mighty shaky if i was

xxviii that night tom and
distance and the other the tavern
nobody entered the alley or left
nobody resembling the spaniard entered or
the tavern door the
maow whereupon he would slip out and
the keys but the night remained clear
huck closed his watch and retired
bed in an empty sugar hogshead
twelve tuesday the boys had
but thursday night promised better tom
out in good season with
aunt s old tin lantern and
put out no spaniard had been
nobody had entered or left
alley everything was auspicious the blackness of
occasional mutterings of distant thunder
hogshead wrapped it closely in
into the alley then
a mountain he began to
he could see a flash
it seemed hours since tom had
surely he must have fainted maybe
had burst under terror and excitement
his uneasiness huck found himself drawing closer
closer to the alley fearing all sorts
dreadful things and momentarily expecting some
inhale it by thimblefuls and his heart
soon wear itself out the way it
beating suddenly there was a flash
light and tom came tearing by
or forty miles an hour before
as they got within its
the storm burst and the rain
down as soon as tom
his breath he said huck it was
as soft as i
but they seemed to make such a
was so scared they wouldn t
without noticing what i
doing i took hold
the knob and open comes the door
in and shook off the
and great caesar s ghost
what d you see tom huck i

i won t come bothering around
s family had come back to
the night before both injun joe and
treasure sunk into secondary importance for
moment and becky took the chief
in the boy s interest he saw
playing hi spy and gully keeper with
crowd of their school mates
day was completed and
in a peculiarly satisfactory way becky teased
day for the long
and long delayed picnic and
tom s not more moderate
invitations were sent out before
of the village were thrown into a
of preparation and pleasurable
tom s excitement enabled
pretty late hour and he
good hopes of hearing huck s
and of having his treasure
astonish becky and the picnickers
came that night morning came eventually and
giddy and rollicking company were gathered
for elderly people to mar
picnics with their presence the
were considered safe enough
the wings of a few
ladies of eighteen and
ferryboat was chartered for the
miss the fun mary remained at home
not get back till late perhaps you
better stay all night
ll stay with susy
mamma very well and mind and behave
they tripped along tom said to
say i ll tell you
joe harper s we ll climb
up the hill and stop at
widow douglas she ll have
cream she has it
to have us oh that will be
then becky reflected a
and said but what
mamma say how ll she ever
the girl turned the idea over in
reckon it s wrong
t know and so
s the harm all she
said go there if she d
thought of it i know she
the widow douglas splendid hospitality was a
that maybe huck might come this very
and give the signal the thought
a deal of the
out of his anticipations still
why should he give it up he
the signal did not
it be any more
to come to night
sure fun of the evening outweighed
he determined to yield to the stronger
and not allow himself
another time that day
miles below town the ferryboat stopped
the mouth of a
hollow and tied up the
swarmed ashore and soon the forest
and craggy heights echoed far and
different ways of getting hot
tired were gone through with and by
by the rovers straggled
and then the destruction
the feast there was a
season of rest and
by and by somebody shouted who
ready for the cave
of the cave was up the hillside
with solid limestone that was
the deep gloom and look out
the green valley shining in the sun
the impressiveness of the
but the candle was soon knocked
or blown out and then there
down the steep descent of the main
their point of junction sixty
feet wide every few
other lofty and still narrower crevices
from it on either hand for
s cave was but a vast labyrinth
and out again and
end of the cave
and no end to any of them
impossible thing most of the young men
beyond this known portion tom
knew as much of the cave
any one the procession moved
of a mile and then
and couples began to slip aside into
avenues fly along the dismal corridors
at points where the corridors joined
each other for the space of half
and by one group after another
delighted with the success of
day then they were astonished to find
they had been taking
note of time and
night was about at hand the clanging
had been calling for half an hour
s adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory
the ferryboat with her
freight pushed into the stream nobody cared
for the wasted time but the
of the craft huck was already upon
watch when the ferryboat s lights went
subdued and still as
usually are who are nearly tired
death he wondered what boat it was
why she did not stop at the
attention upon his business
ceased scattered lights began to
out all straggling foot passengers disappeared
village betook itself to its
clock came and the tavern
huck waited what seemed a weary
was there any use
there really any use why not give
up and turn in a noise fell
his ear he was all attention in
instant the alley door closed
he sprang to the corner
the brick store the next moment
men brushed by him and
seemed to have something under his
it must be that
so they were going
get away with the box
them he would trust
out and glided along
the men cat like with
just far enough ahead not to be
they moved up the river
three blocks then turned to the left
a cross street they went straight
then until they came
this they took they passed by the
welshman s house half way up the
without hesitating and still climbed upward
thought huck they will
it in the old
between the tall sumach
for they would never be
piece then stopped altogether listened
sound none save that he
to hear the beating of his
came over the hill ominous
but no footsteps heavens
everything lost he was about to spring
throat not four feet from
huck s heart shot into
throat but he swallowed it
and then he stood there
as if a dozen agues
and so weak that he thought he
surely fall to the ground
knew where he was he knew he
within five steps of
grounds very well he thought
hard to find now there was
company there s lights
see any this was
stranger s voice the
then was the revenge job
remembered that the widow douglas had been
to him more than
her he wished he
and more in the moment that
between the stranger s
your way now this way now you
there is company there i reckon
give it up give it up
i just leaving this country forever
for her swag you may have
a vagrant and that
horsewhipped in front of
i ll take it out of her
don t kill her don t do
kill who said anything about
her ears like a sow by
that s keep your
you i ll tie her
the bed if she bleeds
ll not cry if she does
for my sake that s
you re here i mightn t be
about who done this business well if
s get at it the quicker the
here i ll get suspicious
ll wait till the lights are out
s no hurry huck felt
a silence was going
any amount of murderous
so he held his breath and
gingerly back planted his foot carefully and
after balancing one legged in
precarious way and almost toppling over first
one side and then on the other
another and another and a twig snapped
and he listened there
no sound the stillness
turned in his tracks between
himself as carefully as
he were a ship
along when he emerged at the quarry
up his nimble heels
banged at the door and presently the
from windows what s the row
who s banging what do you want
me in quick i ll
finn quick let me in huckleberry
indeed it ain t a name
don t ever tell i
when he got in please don
i d be killed
but the widow s been
friends to me sometimes
i want to tell
was me by george he
got something to tell or he
later the old man and
sons well armed were up
hill and just entering the
path on tiptoe their weapons
their hands huck accompanied them no further
silence and then all of a sudden
was an explosion of firearms and
sprang away and sped down the hill
him chapter xxx as the earliest
of dawn appeared on sunday morning
came groping up the hill and
gently at the old
s door the inmates were
was set on a hair trigger on
there huck s scared
answered in a low
please let me in it s
huck finn it s a name
can open this door night or
lad and welcome these
strange words to the vagabond boy
had ever heard he
not recollect that the closing
had ever been applied
his case before the door was quickly
and he entered huck
given a seat and
old man and his
re good and hungry because
as the sun s up
too make yourself easy
that i and the boys hoped you
turn up and stop here last
i was awful scared said huck
went off and i didn t
becuz i wanted to know
it you know and i come
daylight becuz i didn
want to run across them devils
if they was dead well poor
had a hard night
you when you ve
t dead lad we
right where to put our
till we got within fifteen feet of
dark as a cellar that sumach path
and just then i found i
going to sneeze it was
meanest kind of luck i tried
come i was in the lead
those scoundrels a rustling to get
and blazed away at the place where
rustling was so did
through the woods i judge we never
apiece as they started but their
whizzed by and didn t do
any harm as soon as we
the sound of their feet
quit chasing and went
and stirred up the
they got a posse together and went
as soon as it
going to beat up the woods my
we had some sort
a good deal but you couldn
see what they were
in the dark lad i suppose
yes i saw them
town and follered them
that s ben around
once or twice and
that s enough lad we
the men happened on them
away off with you boys and tell
sheriff get your breakfast
sons departed at once as
exclaimed oh please don t tell anybody
please don t tell when the
men were gone the old welshman said
won t tell and i won t
why don t you want
known huck would not
that he knew anything
he would be killed for knowing it
said how did you come to
these fellows lad were
looking suspicious huck was silent while
framed a duly cautious
then he said well you see
sleep much on account of thinking about
it all over and when
got to that old shackly brick store
the temperance tavern i backed up agin
wall to have another think
just then along comes
two chaps slipping along close by
with something under their arm and
was a smoking and t other one
a light so they stopped right before
and the cigars lit up their faces
i see that the
one was the deaf and dumb
a rusty ragged looking
huck for a moment then he
it seems as if i did
they went on and you follered
what was up they sneaked along
and your two what the deaf
keep the old man from getting
spaniard might be and
his tongue seemed determined
presently the welshman said
i wouldn t hurt
hair of your head for all
d protect you this spaniard is not
and dumb you ve
you can t cover that up now
want to keep dark now trust
tell me what it is and
me i won t betray
huck looked into the old man
honest eyes a moment then bent
a moment he said it s
own embellishment because white
revenge but an injun that
a different matter altogether during breakfast the
went on and in the course
thing which he and his sons had
before going to bed was
get a lantern and
for marks of blood they found none
captured a bulky bundle of of what
could not have leaped
s blanched lips his eyes were
wide now and his breath suspended waiting
the answer the welshman started stared in
three seconds five seconds ten
the matter with you huck sank back
gently but deeply unutterably grateful the welshman
him gravely curiously and presently
relieve you a good
but what did give
that turn what were
expecting we d found
was in a close place the
anything for material for a plausible
nothing suggested itself the inquiring eye was
deeper and deeper a
reply offered there was no
to weigh it so
a venture he uttered it feebly sunday
books maybe poor huck was too
to smile but the old man laughed
and joyously shook up
doctor s bill like
white and jaded you ain t
a bit no wonder you re
little flighty and off your balance but
will fetch you out all right
think he had been such
goose and betrayed such
had heard the talk at the
it was not the treasure however
had not known that it
t and so the
of a captured bundle was too
for his self possession
beyond all question that that bundle
not the bundle and so
drifting just in the right
now the treasure must
be captured and jailed that
and he and tom
just as breakfast was completed
door huck jumped for a hiding
for he had no mind
be connected even remotely with the
event the welshman admitted several
and gentlemen among them
widow douglas and noticed that groups
citizens were climbing up the hill to
at the stile so
the widow s gratitude for
word about it madam there
to than you are
he don t allow
to tell his name we
t have been there but for him
so vast that it almost belittled
main matter but the welshman allowed it
eat into the vitals of his
part with his secret
all else had been learned the
said i went to sleep reading in
and slept straight through
that noise why didn
warn t worth while those fellows
t likely to come
they hadn t any tools
to work with and
they ve just come back more visitors
couple of hours more there
but everybody was early at
the stirring event was well canvassed news
discovered when the sermon was finished judge
as she moved down the aisle
the crowd and said is my becky
to sleep all day
just expected she would be tired to
friend passed by aunt polly
good morning mrs thatcher good morning
reckon my tom stayed at
you and now he s
to come to church i ve got
settle with him mrs thatcher shook her
a marked anxiety came into aunt
s face joe harper
say the people had
moving out of church whispers passed along
a boding uneasiness took
of every countenance children were anxiously
on board the ferryboat on
in the cave mrs thatcher
away aunt polly fell to crying
to street and within
clanging and the whole town
burglars were forgotten horses were
skiffs were manned the ferryboat
an hour old two hundred men
pouring down highroad and river toward the
all the long afternoon
aunt polly and mrs
and tried to comfort them they
better than words all the tedious
and aunt polly also judge
the cave but they conveyed
clay and almost worn out he
huck still in the bed that had
provided for him and delirious with fever
widow douglas came and took
of the patient she said she would
her best by him because
he was good bad or indifferent
was the lord s and nothing
was the lord s was
thing to be neglected the welshman said
had good spots in him and
widow said you can depend
it that s the lord
his hands early in the forenoon parties
village but the strongest
that could be gained was
every corner and crevice
that wherever one wandered
the maze of passages lights were
be seen flitting hither and
in the distance and shoutings and pistol
one place far from the section
traversed by tourists the names becky
rocky wall with candle smoke and near
over it she said it was
last relic she should
memorial of her could ever be so
because this one parted latest from
some said that now
then in the cave a far
speck of light would glimmer and then
glorious shout would burst forth
the echoing aisle and
children were not there it was only
searcher s light three dreadful days
nights dragged their tedious hours along
the village sank into a hopeless
no one had heart for anything
fluttered the public pulse tremendous as the
subject of taverns and finally asked
dreading the worst if anything
been discovered at the temperance tavern
he had been ill yes said
widow huck started up in
it liquor and the place
been shut up lie
child what a turn you
give me only tell me
was it tom sawyer that found
hush i ve told you before you
not talk you are very very
been found there would have been a
gold so the treasure was gone forever
forever but what could she
way through huck s mind and under
widow said to herself there he
pity but somebody could find tom
frolicking began and tom and
they wandered down a
avenue holding their candles aloft
reading the tangled web
of names dates post office
had been frescoed in candle
noticed that they were now
an overhanging shelf and moved on presently
came to a place where
little stream of water trickling
a ledge and carrying a limestone
ages formed a laced and
in order to illuminate it
becky s gratification he found
natural stairway which was
between narrow walls and at once
him becky responded to his call
they made a smoke mark
future guidance and started upon their quest
wound this way and
depths of the cave
another mark and branched
in search of novelties
tell the upper world about in one
whose ceiling depended a multitude
and circumference of a man s
admiring and presently left it by
of the numerous passages that opened into
this shortly brought them
was in the midst of
cavern whose walls were supported
formed by the joining of great
and stalagmites together the
under the roof vast knots of
in a bunch the lights disturbed
squeaking and darting furiously at
of conduct he seized becky s
and hurried her into the first corridor
offered and none too soon for
the children a good
but the fugitives plunged into
got rid of the perilous things
found a subterranean lake shortly
stretched its dim length away
its shape was lost in the shadows
wanted to explore its borders but concluded
it would be best
sit down and rest awhile first now
the first time the deep stillness of
place laid a clammy hand
the spirits of the children becky
ever so long since
heard any of the
come to think becky we
i don t know
east or whichever it is we
apprehensive i wonder how long we ve
down here tom we better
find the way tom it
all a mixed up
to me i reckon i could
put our candles out it
be an awful fix
s try some other way so as
to go through there
but i hope we won t get
it would be so awful and the
traversed it in silence a
becky would watch his face for
come to it right away but he
less and less hopeful with each failure
presently began to turn off
diverging avenues at sheer random
one that was wanted he still said
was all right but there was such
leaden dread at his heart that
words had lost their ring and
just as if he had
all is lost becky clung
tom never mind the bats
worse off all the time
the hush tom shouted the
went echoing down the empty
a faint sound that
is too horrid said
becky they might hear us
than the ghostly laughter it so confessed
perishing hope the children stood still and
but there was no
tom turned upon the back
at once and hurried his
certain indecision in his manner
another fearful fact to becky
tom you didn t make any marks
i was such a fool
t find the way it s
mixed up tom tom we
get out of this awful
oh why did we ever leave
others she sank to
ground and burst into such a frenzy
with the idea that
sat down by her and put his
bosom she clung to him
poured out her terrors her unavailing
and the far echoes turned
he fell to blaming
abusing himself for getting her into this
she said she would try to hope
she would get up and follow
he might lead if only he would
talk like that any more for
moved on again aimlessly simply
random all they could do
to move keep moving for a
it but only because it is its
not been taken out of it by
and familiarity with failure by and
tom took becky s candle and
much words were not needed becky understood
her hope died again she
that tom had a whole candle
his pockets yet he must
by and by fatigue began to assert
it was dreadful to
to be so precious moving in
was to invite death and
its pursuit at last becky s
limbs refused to carry her farther she
friends there and the comfortable
and above all the light becky cried
tom tried to think
some way of comforting her but all
encouragements were grown threadbare
use and sounded like
fatigue bore so heavily upon becky
she drowsed off to
tom was grateful he
looking into her drawn face and saw
grow smooth and natural
the influence of pleasant dreams and
there the peaceful face reflected somewhat
bygone times and dreamy memories while he
deep in his musings
how could i sleep i
i never never had waked no
i won t say it
i m glad you
out we can try
beautiful country in my dream i reckon
are going there maybe not
s go on trying they
hopeless they tried to estimate how long
all they knew was that it
days and weeks and
not be for their candles were
this they could not tell how long
and listen for dripping water
found one presently and
said it was time to
yet becky said she
she was surprised to hear tom
she could not understand
they sat down and
soon busy nothing was
out of his pocket do
remember this said he
tom yes i wish it was as
ve got i saved it from
the cake and becky ate
good appetite while tom
abundance of cold water to
the feast with by and
on again tom was silent
can you bear it
face paled but she thought she could
then becky we must stay here where
piece is our last candle becky
he could to comfort her
with little effect at length becky
tom well becky they ll miss us
will maybe they re hunting for
now tom why i reckon
they are i hope they are
we hadn t come i don
know but anyway your mother
miss you as soon
they got home a frightened
in becky s face
he had made a blunder
was not to have gone home that
the children became silent and thoughtful in
moment a new burst of grief from
the sabbath morning might be half
before mrs thatcher discovered that becky
not at mrs harper s the
fastened their eyes upon their bit of
and watched it melt
and pitilessly away saw the
inch of wick stand alone at last
the feeble flame rise and fall
and then the horror of utter
reigned how long afterward it was that
came to a slow consciousness that she
crying in tom s arms
after what seemed a mighty
of time both awoke out
a dead stupor of sleep
he tried to get becky
talk but her sorrows were too
all her hopes were gone
said that they must
doubt the search was
on he would shout
that he tried it no more
again a portion of tom s
of the cake was left they divided
ate it but they seemed
both held their breath
listened there was a sound
by the hand started groping down
again the sound was heard and apparently
little nearer it s them
tom they re coming come along becky
re all right now the joy of
prisoners was almost overwhelming their speed
had to be guarded
they shortly came to one and had
stop it might be three feet deep
passing it at any rate
and reached as far down
he could no bottom they must
growing more distant a moment or
sinking misery of it tom whooped until
no use he talked hopefully to becky
an age of anxious waiting passed and
way back to the
they slept again and
famished and woe stricken tom
it must be tuesday by this
now an idea struck him
were some side passages near at
it would be better to explore some
line from his pocket
it to a projection and
unwinding the line as he groped
at the end of twenty steps the
ended in a jumping off
tom got down on his
and felt below and then
far around the corner
he could reach with his hands conveniently
little farther to the right and at
hand was followed by the
was vastly gratified the next
to see the spaniard take
his heels and get himself out of
tom wondered that joe
but the echoes must
it he reasoned tom s fright weakened
muscle in his body he
to himself that if he
he had seen he told her
had only shouted for
but hunger and wretchedness
superior to fears in
long run another tedious wait
the spring and another long sleep brought
tom believed that it must
wednesday or thursday or even friday or
now and that the search had been
over he proposed to
another passage he felt willing
becky was very weak
and would not be
now where she was and die
her and she made him promise
when the awful time
he would stay by her and
her hand until all was
of being confident of finding the searchers
an escape from the cave then he
one of the passages on
hands and knees distressed with hunger and
with bodings of coming
and waned to the twilight
village of st petersburg still
the lost children had
been found public prayers had
a private prayer that
the petitioner s whole heart
it but still no good news came
back to their daily avocations saying
the time delirious people said it was
to hear her call her
and raise her head and listen a
minute at a time then lay
aunt polly had drooped
had grown almost white the village
to its rest on tuesday night
and forlorn away in the
of the night a wild peal burst
the village bells and in a moment
streets were swarming with
half clad people who
were added to the din the
the river met the children
in an open carriage drawn by
huzzah after huzzah the village was illuminated
night the little town had ever
during the first half hour a
of villagers filed through
thatcher s house seized
s hand tried to speak but couldn
the place aunt polly
happiness was complete and mrs
cave should get the
to her husband tom lay
auditory about him and
the history of the wonderful
with a description of how he
how he followed two
line would reach how he
the kite line and
pushed his head and shoulders through
small hole and saw the broad
rolling by and if it had
would not have explored that passage any
becky and broke the
news and she told
not to fret her
and knew she was going to
and wanted to he described how he
with her and convinced
she actually saw the
speck of daylight how he
his way out at
out how they sat
and cried for gladness
a skiff and tom
their famished condition how
men didn t believe the wild tale
first because said they
the valley the cave is in
gave them supper made them
till two or three hours
dark and then brought
in the cave by the twine clews
informed of the great news three days
nights of toil and hunger in the
were not to be
soon discovered they were bedridden all
to grow more and more tired
a little on thursday was down town
becky did not leave her
she had passed through a wasting illness
see him on friday but could
could he on saturday or
he was admitted daily after that but
and introduce no exciting topic the widow
stayed by to see that he
at home tom learned of
cardiff hill event also that the
in the river near the
s rescue from the cave
exciting talk and tom
s way and he stopped to
becky the judge and some friends
tom to talking and some
the cave again tom said
thought he wouldn t mind it the
said well there are others
like you tom i ve not the
doubt but we have taken
of that nobody will get lost
because i had its
door sheathed with boiler iron two
ago and triple locked and i
got the keys tom turned as
as a sheet what s the
and thrown into tom
face ah now you re all
what was the matter with you
cave chapter xxxiii within
few minutes the news
spread and a dozen skiff loads
men were on their
to mcdougal s cave and the ferryboat
filled with passengers soon followed tom sawyer
joe lay stretched upon
crack of the door as if
moment upon the light and the cheer
the free world outside tom
touched for he knew by his
experience how this wretch had
his pity was moved but nevertheless he
an abounding sense of relief and security
which he had not fully
bowie knife lay close by its blade
chipped and hacked through with
for the native rock formed a
but if there had been
could not have squeezed his body
the door and he knew
order to be doing something in order
pass the weary time
order to employ his tortured
there by tourists but there
none now the prisoner had searched
out and eaten them he had
contrived to catch a
from a stalactite overhead
captive had broken off the
wherein he had scooped
shallow hollow to catch the precious
with the dreary regularity
a clock tick a
when troy fell when the
crucified when the conqueror created the
empire when columbus sailed when the
at lexington was news it is falling
things shall have sunk down the
during five thousand years to be ready
this flitting human insect
come no matter it
since the hapless half breed scooped out
stone to catch the priceless drops
longest at that pathetic stone and
slow dropping water when he comes
see the wonders of mcdougal
cave injun joe s cup
marvels even aladdin s palace cannot
near the mouth of
cave and people flocked
the towns and from
the farms and hamlets for seven miles
they brought their children and
as satisfactory a time at the funeral
they could have had
the hanging this funeral stopped the further
the governor for injun joe
pardon the petition had been
signed many tearful and
meetings had been held and
committee of sappy women been appointed to
around the governor and implore him to
a merciful ass and trample his duty
foot injun joe was believed to have
five citizens of the village but
of that if he
been satan himself there
have been plenty of weaklings
from their permanently impaired and
tom s adventure from
welshman and the widow douglas by this
but tom said he reckoned there
one thing they had not told
that thing was what
what it is you got into no
told me it was you but i
knowed it must a ben you soon
got at me some way or other
told me even if
s always told me
to the picnic don t you

i follered injun joe
injun joe s left friends behind him
i don t want
souring on me and doing
mean tricks if it
t ben for me he d
right then huck told his entire adventure
back to the main question whoever
money too i reckon anyways it s
goner for us tom
that money wasn t ever in
face keenly tom have you got on

now is it fun or earnest earnest
i was in my
will you go in
if it s where

get lost huck we can do that
the money s huck you just
don t find it i
agree to give you
will by jings all right it s
now if you say it are
strong enough is it
in the cave i ben on my
days now but i can
walk more n a mile
least i don t think
could it s about five mile
there the way anybody but me would
huck but there s a mighty
cut that they don t anybody
take you right to it in a
there and i ll pull it back
all by myself you
t ever turn your hand
right we want some bread
of these new fangled things they
lucifer matches i tell
had some when i was
there before a trifle
they were several miles below cave
tom said now you see this
from the cave hollow no houses no
do you see that white place up
landslide well that s one of my
we ll get ashore now
landed now huck where we re
standing you could touch that
place about and found
thick clump of sumach
and said here you are
hole in this country you
a robber but i knew i
got to have a
across it was the bother we ve
it now and we ll keep it
got to be a gang or
don t it huck well
the way and kill them
raise all they can off n
friends and after you
raised then you kill them
s the general way only
shut up the women but you don
kill them they re always beautiful
rich and awfully scared you take their
take your hat off and talk polite
robbers you ll see that
any book well the women get
in the cave a week or two
they stop crying and
that you couldn t get them
they d turn right around
come back it s so
all the books why it s
bully tom i believe it s
in the lead they toiled their
tunnel then made their spliced kite
fast and moved on
a shudder quiver all through
he showed huck the fragment of
wick perched on a
of clay against the wall and
whispers now for the stillness and
of the place oppressed their spirits they
on and presently entered
followed tom s other corridor
not really a precipice but
or thirty feet high tom
now i ll show
something huck he held his candle aloft
said look as far
do you see that there on the
rock over yonder done with
smoke tom it s
yonder s where i saw injun joe
up his candle huck
then said with a shaky voice tom
git out of here what
leave the treasure yes leave
about there certain no
where he died away out
the mouth of the cave five
from here no tom
money i know the
to fear that huck was
misgivings gathered in his
him lookyhere huck what fools
re making of ourselves
there s a cross
point was well taken it had its
tom i didn t
s luck for us that
there and have a hunt for that
tom went first cutting rude steps
out of the small cavern
the base of the rock
a pallet of blankets spread down in
also an old suspender
of two or three
but there was no
this place but in vain
said he said under the cross
this comes nearest to being under the
the rock itself because
sets solid on the ground they searched
nothing by and by
one side of this rock
not on the other sides
what s that for
bet you the money
under the rock i m
to dig in the clay that ain
no bad notion tom said
was out at once and
had not dug four inches before
that huck began to dig and scratch
and removed they had concealed a
chasm which led under the rock tom
as far under the rock
rift he proposed to explore he
way descended gradually he followed its
course first to the right then to
left huck at his heels tom
and exclaimed my goodness huck
a snug little cavern along with an
powder keg a couple
pairs of old moccasins a leather belt
some other rubbish well soaked with
coins with his hand my
we d get it
believe but we have
box it weighed about fifty
awkward fashion but could not carry it
it like it was heavy
reckon i was right
think of fetching the
bags and the boys took
less fetch the guns and
there they re just the
time and we ll hold our
awful snug place for
what orgies i dono but
always have orgies and of
we ve got to have
too come along huck we
getting late i reckon i m hungry
we ll eat and smoke
skiff as the sun dipped toward
got under way tom skimmed up the
dark now huck said tom
ll hide the money
come up in the morning and we
count it and divide and then we
woods for it where
till i run and hook benny
s little wagon i won
be gone a minute he disappeared and
it threw some old
off dragging his cargo behind him when
boys reached the welshman
were about to move on the welshman
and tom sawyer good come along
it s not as
in it or old metal old
this town will take more trouble and
away more time hunting up
bits worth of old iron
make twice the money at
work but that s
mind you ll see when we
to the widow douglas huck said with
well i don t

know about that ain
to me anyway all right
for this question was not entirely answered
he found himself pushed
jones left the wagon
the door and followed the place was
lighted and everybody that was of
the thatchers were there the harpers
many more and all dressed in their
the widow received the boys as heartily
any one could well receive two
looking beings they were
polly blushed crimson with humiliation and
said tom wasn t at home yet

along in a hurry
you did just right said the widow

here couldn t get along
widow s i reckon mr jones was
flat sid chuckled in a
contented and satisfied way sid
it you that told oh
one person in this
that s you if
had been in huck s place
hill and never told anybody on the
you can t do any
mean things and you
praised for doing good ones
no thanks as the widow
and tom cuffed sid s ears and
him to the door with several
now go and tell
if you dare and to
and a dozen children were propped
at little side tables in the
room after the fashion of that country
that day at the
honor she was doing himself
his sons but said that there
so forth and so
he sprung his secret about huck
the finest dramatic manner he was
of but the surprise it occasioned
effusive as it might
so many compliments and
a target for everybody
said she meant to
huck a home under
roof and have him
and that when she could spare the
she would start him in business in
modest way tom s chance was come
a heavy strain upon
due and proper complimentary
the silence was a little awkward
broke it huck s got money maybe
don t believe it but he s
lots of it oh
minute tom ran out of doors
company looked at each other
at huck who was tongue tied sid
ails tom said aunt
making of that boy out i
his sacks and aunt
mass of yellow coin upon
table and said there
did i tell you half
it s huck s
said he could furnish it
he did the tale was long
brimful of interest there was scarcely an
the charm of its flow when
had finished mr jones said i thought
had fixed up a little surprise for
occasion but it don t
mighty small i m willing to allow
one present had ever seen at one
were worth considerably more than
in property chapter xxxv the reader may
made a mighty stir
the poor little village
st petersburg so vast a sum
in actual cash seemed next
incredible it was talked
gloated over glorified until the reason
many of the citizens
under the strain of the unhealthy excitement
haunted house in st
and the neighboring villages
dissected plank by plank and its
dug up and ransacked
hidden treasure and not by boys
men pretty grave unromantic men too
stared at the boys were not
possessed weight before but now their sayings
seemed somehow to be regarded
remarkable they had evidently lost the
moreover their past history was
conspicuous originality the village paper
biographical sketches of the boys
with tom s at aunt polly s
each lad had an income now that
simply prodigious a dollar for every
of the sundays it was
couldn t collect it a dollar and
quarter a week would
lodge and school a
in those old simple days and clothe

have got his daughter out of the

strict confidence how tom had
her whipping at school
judge was visibly moved and when
lie which tom had told
order to shift that whipping from
said with a fine outburst that
breast with george washington s
truth about the hatchet becky
tall and so superb
when he walked the floor
stamped his foot and
a great lawyer or
great soldier some day he said
he might be ready for
and the fact that
was now under the
douglas protection introduced him into society
him into it and
sufferings were almost more than he could
the widow s servants kept
clean and neat combed and brushed and
bedded him nightly in
press to his heart
know for a friend he
fork he had to use napkin
and plate he had

three weeks and then one day

morning tom sawyer wisely went poking among
old empty hogsheads down
one of them he found the refugee

1922 a table of contents my
flappers the jelly bean this is a
story with the scene laid
the small lily of tarleton georgia i
a profound affection for tarleton but
whenever i write a story about
south denouncing me in no
terms the jelly bean published in the
under strange circumstances shortly after my
was the first story
which i had a collaborator for
that i was unable to manage the
to my wife who
the technique and terminology of that
sectional pastime the camel
all the stories i have ever
travail and perhaps gave me
most amusement as to the
involved it was written during
a platinum and diamond wrist
i began it at seven in the
and finished it at two
clock the same night it was published
included in the o henry memorial collection
the same year i
was derived from the fact that the
have a standing engagement with
party to which we are
invited attired as the latter part of
camel this as a sort
atonement for being his historian
day this somewhat unpleasant tale published
a novelette in the smart set
which took place in the
of the three events
a great impression upon me in
they were unrelated except by the general
of that spring which inaugurated the age
jazz but in my story i
generation porcelain and pink
inquired the young lady oh yes i
her i ve had some stories
plays in the smart set
set she exclaimed how can you why
publish stuff about girls in blue bathtubs
i had the magnificent joy of
her that she was referring to porcelain
pink which had appeared there several months
ritz these next stories are written in
should call my second manner the
as big as the ritz which appeared
summer in the smart set
designed utterly for my
amusement i was in
familiar mood characterized by a perfect craving
luxury and the story
as an attempt to
that craving on imaginary
one well known critic
been pleased to like this
better than anything i have written
i prefer the offshore
but to tamper slightly
lincoln if you like this
of thing this possibly
the sort of thing you ll like
inspired by a remark of
twain s to the
that it was a pity
the best part of life came at
end by trying the experiment
only one man in a
a fair trial several
after completing it i discovered
s note books the
cincinnati sir i have read the
benjamin button in colliers and i
you would make a good
i have seen many peices
cheese in my life but of
the peices of cheese
peice i hate to waste a
ago this story is a product of
in the smart set in 1921 at
time of its conception
i dreaded the obvious in prose if
affection i feel for
just completed the first
of my second novel
a natural reaction made me
in a story wherein none of
characters need be taken
somewhat carried away by the feeling that
was no ordered scheme to
reader may find himself
metropolitan unclassified masterpieces the
to me in an irresistible
but as i saw it it
even of tragedy the
handling of it it
laurel leaf or some such encomium
as a rule to stark melodramas
a volcano or the ghost of john
carefully disguised by early paragraphs in
subtle complexities to follow on
order the case of shaw mcphee
almost incredible attitude of martin sulo this
observers whose names for the present
must conceal it seems
etc etc etc until the
rat of fiction is
last forced out into
this has the distinction of being the
a new york hotel the business was
in a bedroom in

fitting period of mourning had
it was published in
smart set jemina written
tarquin of cheapside while
was at princeton this sketch was published
technique i must apologize to mr
leacock i have laughed
first wrote it but i
is amusing i include it
it seems to me worth
a few years at least until the
my books and it
impossible table of contents i tender
tales of the jazz age
the hands of those who read
read my last flappers the jelly
much as i desire to make him
unscrupulous to deceive you on that
he was a bred in the bone
cent jelly bean and he grew
all during jelly bean season
is every season down in
land of the jelly
well below the mason dixon
now if you call a
convenient telegraph pole if you call
new orleans man a jelly bean
you who is taking your girl to
mardi gras ball the particular jelly bean
which produced the protagonist of this
lies somewhere between the two a
city of forty thousand that
dozed sleepily for forty thousand years
muttering something about a war
that everyone else has forgotten
that again because it has such
pleasant sound rather like the
jim were nice it
gives me a picture of him with
of leaves and vegetables growing out
and bent at the waist from stooping
what might have been known
in the first person
i am idling i have idled
in a white house on a green
it had four weather beaten
in front and a great
of lattice work in the rear that
a cheerful criss cross background for
flowery sun drenched lawn originally
to that but this
been so long ago
even jim s father scarcely remembered it
he was dying from a pistol wound
little jim who was
years old and miserably frightened the white
became a boarding house run
a tight lipped lady
macon whom jim called aunt mamie
detested with all his
he became fifteen went to
and was afraid of
he hated his home where four women
one old man prolonged an interminable
from summer to summer
what lots the powell
had originally included and
sorts of flowers would be
resemblance in the dark eyes
hair invited him to
much preferred sitting on a disconnected axle
long straw for pocket
he picked up odd jobs and
was due to this that
a boy who brought the
dice and had listened to spicy
occurred in the surrounding country
the war broke out and
enlisted as a gob and polished
then by way of
in the brooklyn navy yard for a
when the war was over he
home he was twenty one
over it were two blue eyes faded
a piece of very good
cloth long exposed to the sun in
a soft gray had drifted
along the cottonfields and
the sultry town he was
vague figure leaning against
board fence whistling and gazing at the
s rim above the lights of
street his mind was working persistently on
problem that had held
attention for an the jelly
when all the boys had detested all
girls clark darrow and jim
died in the oily
in and out of love gone to
short become one of
best beaux of the town nevertheless
and jim had retained a
definite that afternoon clark s
ford had slowed up beside jim who
on the sidewalk and
of a clear sky
invited him to a
at the country club
no stranger than the impulse which
jim accept the latter
jim was soberly thinking it over
began to sing drumming his long foot
the sidewalk till it wobbled
tune one smile from home in
queen she loves her dice and treats
muttered half aloud they would
be there the old crowd the
to which by right of
white house sold long
and the portrait of the officer
gray over the mantel jim should
belonged but that crowd had grown
boys trousers had dropped suddenly to
and dead puppy loves jim was
outsider a running mate of poor whites

the last shoppers were drifting homeward as
a slow merry go
blend of music to the night an
cheerful rendition of back
a store and bought
summer evening parked in front and
little darkies running back and forth

an automobile with marylyn
nancy lamar and a
man were in the back
the jelly bean tipped
hat quickly hi ben
passing he ambled on toward the garage
he had a room up stairs his
y all had been said to nancy
a remembered kiss and shadowy eyes and
black hair inherited from her mother
had been born in
walking small boy fashion
her hands in her pockets and
knew that with her
sally carrol hopper she
left a trail of
hearts from atlanta to new
for a few fleeting
jim wished he could dance then
laughed and as he reached his
her eyes are big
brown she s the queen of
of jelly bean town ii at nine

like bright birds smiling over their powdered
at the chaperones casting a quick glance
to take in the room and simultaneously
room s reaction to their
and then again like birds alighting and
in the sober arms of

pink and blinking like
awakened rose marjorie haight marylyn wade
and red and gold fresh from the
totally uncheered by clark s jovial
which were each one accompanied

but at half past
his embarrassment suddenly left him and
pull of breathless interest took him completely
of himself nancy lamar had come out
hundred cool corners with three tiers
ruffles and a big
yellow around her in
sort of phosphorescent lustre the
jim recognized him as the
who had been with her

a deserted corner dark between the
on the lawn and the
lighted door of the ballroom there he

her timidly ah but watch this one

her luck was holding she
the pot up and
refusing to drag taylor was drumming
his fingers on the
but he was in to stay
and lost the dice taylor seized them
he shot in silence and in
hush of excitement the clatter
one pass after another on the table

to the money clark
an uncertain but alarmed
with joe ewing taylor

low lazy voice a little strained
sleepy and listless nancy flung
dice down before him

said jim carelessly we ll shoot for
the cash half an hour later nancy
the back stole my luck you did
was nodding her head
jim swept up the last check
putting it with the others
them into confetti and scattered them
nancy kicking her chair backward rose
her feet ladies and
she announced ladies that

the porch over the cricket loud lawn

say something to her angrily saw
laugh and turning away walk with
eyes to his car marylyn
a jazz baby clark came out
joined jim on the
all pretty lit i guess
yawned merritt s in a
mood he s certainly off nancy
itself across the feet
the night the party in the
began to chant a chorus
night everybody called clark good night clark
night jelly bean the car
a last negro waiter turned out
porch light jim and clark strolled
toward the ford their
crunching raucously on the gravel drive
boy sighed clark softly
you can set those dice it
still too dark for him to see
flush on jim s
a flush of unfamiliar shame iv
tilly s garage a
room echoed all day
singing of the negro washers as
cars outside it was a cheerless
of a room punctuated with a bed
a battered table on which lay half
dozen books joe miller s
old edition very much annotated in an
fashioned hand the eyes of the
by harold bell wright
alice powell and the date 1831
on the fly leaf the
electric light he snapped it out again
his elbows on the sill
stared into the deepening morning
first perception was a sense of
had sprung up suddenly around
hedging him in a
the white wall of his
this wall all that
the light hearted improvidence
miraculous open handedness of life faded out
jelly bean strolling up
street humming a lazy song known at
of easy greeting and local wit sad
for only the sake of sadness and
name was a reproach
insight he knew that merritt must despise
not jealousy but only a contempt for
s so lowering herself and on
a dingy subterfuge learned from the garage
his as the gray became
brightened and filled the room
i love her he cried aloud god
over on his face he began to
dully into the pillow in the
of three o clock clark
chugging painfully along jackson
bean who stood on
curb with his fingers in his vest
hi called clark bringing his ford to
astonishing stop alongside just get
out in the country just got into
restless i been feeling thataway all
i m thinkin of leavin
continued the jelly bean absorbed
his own thoughts been thinkin of
a little that work
uncle dun reckin i been bummin
continued i reckin maybe after aunt mamie
i could sink that money of
it all my people originally
from that part up there
a big place clark looked
said this this sort of affected
don t know he began slowly somethin
about that girl last night
about a lady named
manners an english lady
i had a family
he said defiantly clark nodded i
and i m the last
by means jelly weak and
on the street again clark was silent
and when i come back to this
clark took out his handkerchief and wiped
going to stop right
to see it thataway
you mean demanded jim in surprise that
that s leaked out leaked out
put his hands on the sides
the car and tightened his long fingers
the metal do you
taylor investigated those checks it was
s turn to be
haven t you heard
happened jim s startled eyes
answer enough why announced clark dramatically
four got another bottle
corn got tight and decided
appeared in the metal under the jelly
and frightened to death claimed
d all been a mistake first doctor
went wild and was going
and merritt went to savannah on
two thirty train jim closed
said clark philosophically i don t
the wedding reckon that s
guess nancy cared a darn about him
it s a crime for
and turned away again something was
on inside him some inexplicable but
the jelly bean turned and looked
back over his shoulder got to go
four the april dust
to enmesh the sun and
forever played on an eternity of afternoons
at half past four
first layer of quiet
and the shades lengthened under the awnings
all life was weather a waiting through
hot where events had no
for the cool that
soft and caressing like a woman s
georgia there is a
perhaps inarticulate that this
the greatest wisdom of
south so after a
the jelly bean turned into a
on jackson street where he was

the tall hat summoned a taxi
to mister go to
s costume fella ii mrs nolak
short and ineffectual looking
belonged for a while to
unsettled european conditions she had never since
quite sure what she was the shop
their daily stint was dim and
and peopled with suits
armor and chinese mandarins and enormous
m�ch� birds suspended from the
in a vague background many rows
masks glared eyelessly at
crowns and scepters and jewels
hair and wigs of all colors
for you she queried pessimistically
stitch of charioteer had been rented long
was it for the townsends
ball it was sorry she
was an obstacle hm
perry an idea struck him
if you ve got a
of canvas i could
s a tent sorry but we haven
anything like that a
shook his head several of the gentlemen
and swallow tail coats and going as
but we re all out of tall
i can let you have
crape hair for a mustache want somep
stinctive something let s
camel camel the idea seized
s imagination gripped it fiercely yes but
lemme see it the camel was produced
his resting place on a top shelf
first glance he appeared to consist
a sizable hump but
being spread out he
cloth you see it
two people explained mrs
holding the camel in frank
if you have a friend
could be part of it you
there s sorta pants for two people
in back the fella in front does
lookin out through these here
an the fella in back he s
round put it on
her tabby cat face inside the camel
head and turned it from
what noise does a
make what asked mrs nolak as
tried on the head and turned from
to side appraisingly in the
in pessimism decorated with numerous abrasions and
must be admitted that his coat was
that state of general
he needed to be cleaned and pressed
distinctive he certainly was he was
he would have attracted attention in
you see you have to have two
said mrs nolak again perry
gathered up the body and legs
the effect on the whole was bad
was even irreverent like one of those
pictures of a monk changed into a
among blankets don t look like anything
all objected perry gloomily
have two people a solution flashed upon
you got a date to night
i couldn t possibly oh come
said perry encouragingly sure you can
be good sport and climb into
hind legs with difficulty
located them and extended their yawning depths
but mrs nolak seemed
she backed perversely away oh no c
to or we ll
she said with no coyness
he he s home wha s
the telephone number pertaining to
nolak penates and got
communication with that small weary voice he
by perry s brilliant flow
point he refused firmly but with
to help out mr
in the capacity of back
of a camel having rung off
rather having been rung off on perry
stool to think it over
he might call and then his
paused as betty medill
was over but she could not refuse
last request surely it was
much to ask to help him keep
his end of social obligation
one short night and
she insisted she could
and he would go as the
his magnanimity pleased him
mind even turned to rosy colored dreams
a tender reconciliation inside the camel there
away from all the
now you d better
nolak broke in upon
mellow fancies and roused him to action
the medill house miss betty was
had gone out to dinner then when
seemed lost the camel
was a dilapidated individual with a cold
his head and a general trend
him of downwardness his cap was
down low on his head and his
was pulled down low on his chest
the contrary down and out he said
he was the taxicab driver
the gentleman had hired at
clarendon hotel he had been instructed
the gentleman had gone out the
come in he sank
onto the three legged stool wanta
to a party demanded perry
s a very good party s a
a good fella see it s
driver looked at it cynically huh perry
feverishly among the folds
the cloth see he cried
your part you don
even have to talk all you have
do is to walk and sit down
you do all the sitting
think of it i m on
feet all the time and you can
down some of the
down is when we
lying down and you can sit down
thing demanded the individual dubiously a shroud
s a camel huh then perry mentioned
sum of money and the conversation left
land of grunts and assumed
practical tinge perry and the taxi driver
on the camel in front of the
you can t see
explained perry peering anxiously
through the eyeholes but
ole man you look sim ly great
a grunt from the hump
this somewhat dubious compliment honestly you
great repeated perry enthusiastically move round a
the hind legs moved
giving the effect of
said perry the bundle was stowed under
s arm and they left
shop go to the party
the back what party fanzy
the names of all
who had given parties during the
danced confusedly before his
he could ask mrs nolak but
looking out the window he saw
had already faded out
the snowy street drive
directed perry with fine confidence
otherwise i ll tell
hazy daydream and his thoughts
vaguely that they had had a disagreement
the party as the
part of the camel he was just
opening the door and shaking
are maybe perry looked
house from which issued
to night sure everybody s goin
another look at the awning you sure
people ain t gonna
on me for comin here
anybody says anything to
thing rather than a
shelter of the awning and
unrolling the camel let s go
hump might have been seen crossing the
of the howard tate residence passing a
footman without so much as a
and heading directly for the main
ballroom the beast walked with
peculiar gait which varied
but can best be described by
gait and as he walked he alternately
and contracted like a gigantic
who lives in toledo
became a toledo tate and the family
to be the earmark of
about pigs and farms and look at
not amused they have begun to
a lot of money
a quiet way and
lost all sense of competition are in
little millicent tate and though all ages
represented the dancers were mostly
school and college the younger
crowd was at the
club mrs tate was standing
inside tie ballroom following millicent
with her eyes and beaming whenever

that s all no i didn t
it was some kind
down stairs to see if there were

kinda funny mamma like he was lame
then he saw me and gave
sort of growl and then he
at the top of the landing and
ran mrs tate s laugh faded the
must have seen something and suddenly
three women took an
of muffled steps were audible
outside and then three startled gasps
out as a dark
cried mrs tate o o
cried the ladies in
chorus the camel suddenly
his back and the
turned to shrieks oh
what is it the dancing stopped
the dancers hurrying over
quite a different impression of
that it was a stunt a
entertainer come to amuse the
the boys in long trousers looked at
their intelligence was being insulted but the
isn t the funniest the camel
to aide and seeming
take in the room in a
appraising glance then as if he had
to an abrupt decision
turned and ambled swiftly
the door mr howard
had just come out
the library on the
the foot of the stairway of
large brown beast that
a great hurry now what
devil said mr tate starting the
picked itself up not without dignity
affecting an air of extreme nonchalance
if he had just remembered
important engagement started at a mixed
toward the front door in
his front legs began casually to
see here now said mr tate
camel in a pair of compelling arms
realizing that further locomotion was
the front end submitted to
agitation by this time
flood of young people was
young man hold him
him in here we ll soon
the camel consented to be
the young man to take
and returned the revolver to its hiding
well perry parkhurst he exclaimed
tate said perry sheepishly hope i

faint sound of assent sure

hand it back to
smacking sound inspired by
bottles glasses and siphon one of
partner could be heard imbibing long
at frequent intervals thus

of booths representing the various attractions of

the ballroom with pointing arrows alongside and
which instructed the uninitiated to follow the
line the green line led
to the bar where waited pure
and wicked punch and plain dark green
arrow red and very wavy and
it the slogan now follow
but even amid the luxury
costume and high spirits
of a stir and
laughing crowd attempting to penetrate the identity
this beast that stood by the wide
eying the dancers with
saw betty standing in front
was dressed in the costume
with a glittering oriental tiara her
and the half moon of her
writhed painted serpents with single eyes
and her skirt was slit

walked one caught a glimpse of other
serpents painted just above
bare ankles wound about her neck
from her when she

to make great talk about

perry peering through the
shoulders whose mobile expressive gestures made her
the outstanding figure in any group he
effect on him with
growing clarity the events of the day
back rage rose within him and with
half formed intention of taking her away
the crowd he started toward her
rather he elongated slightly for he had
fickle kismet who for
day had played with him bitterly
full for the amusement he had afforded
charmer to the camel kismet led her
camel darned if i
found it necessary to

butterfield the architect from new york
of the provincial girl in the
slight pause at the
of the next dance betty
her partner finished up within a
feet of the camel with the
evening she reached out and
rubbed the camel s nose hello old
me said betty lifting her eyebrows in
don t be you see
pretty good at camels too
camel bowed very low
and the beast mrs
approached the group well mr butterfield she
helpfully i wouldn t have recognised
perry bowed again and smiled
behind his mask and who is
with you she inquired oh said perry
voice muffled by the thick cloth and
unrecognizable he isn t a fellow
townsend he s just part of my
mrs townsend laughed and moved away
turned again to betty
she cares on the
day of our final rupture
starts a flirtation with
impulse he gave her
soft nudge with his shoulder and waved
clear that he desired her to leave
partner and accompany him
by rus she called to her
we going prince of beasts the noble
made no rejoinder but stalked gravely along
the direction of a secluded nook on
side stairs there she seated herself and
camel after some seconds
sounds of a heated
going on in his interior
himself beside her his
legs stretching out uncomfortably across two steps
old egg said betty cheerfully how
you like our happy party the
rolling his head ecstatically and executing a
kick with his hoofs this is
first time that i ever had a
� t�te with a man

brown hand resting lightly on his
defiantly symbolizing her complete adoption of him
they entered the couples were
the walls and mrs townsend resplendent as
calves was standing in the
a signal to the band every
think you can possibly dance perry
enthusiastically he felt suddenly
after all he was
perry danced the cotillion i
danced but that is stretching
word far beyond the wildest
of the jazziest terpsichorean he suffered
partner to put her hands on his
shoulders and pull him
and there over the floor
he hung his huge
docilely over her shoulder
made futile dummy motions with his
a manner all their own chiefly by
was going on or
going through a series of steps
the front part of the
keeping up a constant energetic motion calculated
rouse a sympathetic perspiration
any soft hearted observer he
frequently favored he danced first with
tall lady covered with straw who
with the cardboard wienerwurst or
photograph of the bearded lady or whatever
reached her first but
his rushes were unsuccessful
resulted in intense interior arguments for heaven

masculine and miss betty

and his brilliant dancing throughout the evening

as betty turned to him laughingly

with his arms and declare his identity
kiss those lips that smiled only a
away when suddenly the laughter and applause
perry and betty looked
such a startled voice

tight together and she looked stonily
marion then she rose and scattering
sympathizers right and left

order that they might give
their hands helplessly shouting

adventures that happened in the great city

a few minutes later
dean dressed in blue silk
opened his door and
a half embarrassed exuberance
were both about twenty four
graduates of the year
resemblance stopped abruptly dean was blond
and rugged under his
a sec i ll be right
vanished into the bathroom
visitor s dark eyes roved
a family of thick silk shirts littered
the chairs amid impressive neckties and
woollen socks gordon rose and
yellow with a pale
them he stared involuntarily at his own
cuffs they were ragged and
gray dropping the silk
he held his coat
up till they were out

amusement that only three years before

draping himself reluctantly in fresh
dean lit a cigarette and sat down
the open window inspecting
calves and knees under the morning sunshine

the two became taut
strained after a second gordon

suppliant you seem to manage it pretty
in the position where if
you i m a sucker
yes you do and let
thing for me to get
so big but that a slice
that won t play the deuce
it he left his chair
stretched out his arms
clenched the edges of the bed
back a desire to cry
his head was splitting and whirring
and he could feel the
counts like a slow dripping
a roof dean tied
tie precisely brushed his eyebrows and removed
his cigarette case tossed
empty box thoughtfully into
he demanded no i don t eat
any more well we ll go out

i came east to have
added with an implied reproof

lot to do if i

money he took a
over to gordon who folded it
and put it in his pocket there
his cheeks an added glow
was not fever for an instant
they turned to go out their eyes
and in that instant each
something that made him lower

a dozen neckties selecting each one
long consultations with the other

with a vague idea

of detached yet affectionate admiration he
loved to draw her around his
his eyes shut they left rivers

a dispute about the money they went
with girls mostly from the west
south the stellar d�butantes of many cities
gordon they were faces
a dream he gathered together his forces
to come out with

in a strained and husky voice
but seemed to change his mind
gordon stood there his handsome face awry

his hand then blinded by
tears he stumbled clumsily

were silent for a moment
hot in here ain
it rose agreed earnestly hot as hell
out of the dressing room and
commonplace of her social existence but
night she had no quarrel with
she had acted with
correct mixture of dignity
reticent pity which she always
leaving the biltmore hadn t
lifted his right arm awkwardly she was
it snugly around the crimson
trimmed opera cloak she wore
inevitably more graceful for a young man
to embrace a young lady
whose acquiescence he was
certain to first put his far arm
of raising the near arm his
faux pas was unconscious she
spent the afternoon at
hairdresser s the idea
any calamity overtaking her
his elbow had just faintly brushed it
was his second faux pas two were
the first murmur she had decided that
was twenty two and anyhow this dance
of its kind since the war
of its associations of
else of another dance and
man a man for whom her feelings
been little more than a sad
with her recollection of gordon sterrett so
came out of the dressing room
delmonico s and stood
a second in the
looking over the shoulders of a
the heavy fragrance left by
passage to and fro of many
young beauties rich perfumes and the fragile
laden dust of fragrant powders this
and permeated the ballroom where
was an odor she knew well exciting
restlessly sweet the odor of a
dance she thought of her
would gleam like milk against the
to night the hairdressing had been
success her reddish mass of hair
piled and crushed and creased to an
china eyes she was a complete
delicate quite perfect thing
from a complex coiffure to two
slim feet she thought of
she would say to night at this
faintly prestiged already by the sounds
footsteps and movements of couples up and
had talked for many years
current expressions bits of journalese
college slang strung together into
intrinsic whole careless faintly provocative
sentimental she stalled faintly
she heard a girl sitting on the
know the half of it dearie and
a moment and closing
eyes she drew in a deep breath
pleasure she dropped her arms to
side until they were faintly touching the
sheath that covered and suggested
figure she had never felt her
softness so much nor so enjoyed
whiteness of her own arms
smell sweet she said to
thought i m made for love
which two months before had disclosed
her her unguessed desire
see him again seemed now
have been leading up to
dance this hour for all
sleek beauty edith was a grave slow
that same desire to ponder of that
cornell where he had been an instructor
economies and had come
new york to pour the
weekly newspaper edith less fatuously
have been content to cure gordon sterrett
that she wanted to take care of
was a helplessness in him that she
to protect and she wanted
she had known a long
someone who had loved her a
while she was a
going to be changed she
say something that would change them
thoughts were interrupted by a
undergraduate with a hurt look
who presented himself before her
bowed unusually low it was the man
had come with peter
he was tall and humorous
suddenly rather disliked him probably because he
she began are you still furious
said softly i don t know
i snapped out that
i m in a bum humor to
for some strange reason i
t mention it he felt disagreeably

fact of his late failure it was
mistake she continued on
the floor while the dozen swaying
members of the specially hired jazz
alone why then two is com pan
a man with a mustache cut in

disconsolately off as a man with
inconnu the very fair man insisted

trembling they were dancing quite close

darn many extra fellas that
took a step in her direction her
turned her away she
his voice bleating but
the stags get lit and
low tone at her side may i
his arms was around her

her back with the
she began breathlessly hello edith
over her something was wrong of a
eyes looked down at her she
suddenly that they were blood
and rolling uncontrollably gordon she
want to sit down they were nearly
mid floor but she
seen two men start toward her from
led him bumping through the crowd
mouth tight shut her face
little pale under her rouge
place high up on
soft carpeted stairs and
sat down heavily beside her
certainly am glad to see you edith
looked at him without answering the
for years she had seen men
various stages of intoxication from
she was seized with a new feeling
nodded i ve had trouble edith trouble

this delmonico s as he talked

a faint surprising boredom
great void edith he said i
to think i was clever talented

mouse he laughed bitterly and rather too
i ve become a damn beggar a
on my friends i m a
i m poor as hell her distaste
growing she barely nodded
rise suddenly gordon s eyes
with tears edith he
evidently a strong effort at self control

he repeated well she
slowly looking him in
eye any one s always
m sorry to see you like
gordon there was a
eyes wavered she rose and stood
might have been said the new
words the tendernesses learned
edith was unaccustomed to
snubbed having been snubbed he was
and embarrassed and ashamed of
for a matter of two months he
been on special delivery terms
edith bradin and knowing that the
excuse and explanation of the special
letter is its value in
correspondence he had believed himself
of a simple kiss therefore
he was cut in on
the man with the mustache
went out into the hall
making up a sentence said
over to himself several
considerably deleted this was it well
man on and then
him she did and she has
kick coming if i
out and get beautifully boiled so
walked through the supper room into a
in the evening it was
room in which there were
large bowls of punch flanked
many bottles he took a seat beside
table which held the bottles at
monotony of time the turbidity
which glittering cobwebs formed things became reconciled
arranged themselves in trim formation and at
and with the departure of worry
girl not to be worried
rather to be laughed at
fitted like a figure
his own dream into the surface world
in a measure symbolic
the brilliant dreamer at
then the symbolic mood
and as he sipped his
highball his imagination yielded
state similar to floating on
this point that he noticed that a
baize door near him was open about
inches and that through the
green door closed and then opened
a bare half inch this
peek a boo murmured
became aware of a series of
he s sittin lookin he better beat
off we gotta get
li l bottle peter listened
excited he was jubilant
felt that he had stumbled upon
mystery affecting an elaborate
table then turning quickly pulled open
green door precipitating private
into the room peter bowed how do
slightly in front of
other poised for fight flight or
how do you do repeated peter politely
m o right can
offer you a drink private rose looked
said finally peter indicated
in there he pointed to the
and guilty chairs were found and the
may i ask why you gentlemen prefer
lounge away your leisure hours in
room which is chiefly
as far as i can see
race has progressed to the stage
seventeen thousand chairs are manufactured on
and key regarded him vacantly will
tell me went on
why you choose to
yourselves on articles intended for
transportation of water from one place to
at this point rose contributed a
to the conversation and lastly
are in a building beautifully
with enormous candelabra you prefer to spend
evening hours under one
electric light rose looked at key
to look at each other without
but they were not
him to them a
who talked after this fashion
peter finishing his highball and preparing another
thought perhaps you might be members
well that s too bad no

violet blue as the newspapers say

as good as any lady

greatest race in the
we re all americans have another they
another vi at one o
a special orchestra special even in
day of special orchestras arrived at
s and its members seating themselves arrogantly
the piano took up
burden of providing music
the gamma psi fraternity they were
by a famous flute player distinguished
while he played the latest jazz on
flute during his performance
lights were extinguished except
the spotlight on the flute player and
roving beam that threw
shadows and changing kaleidoscopic colors
the massed dancers edith had danced
into that tired dreamy state habitual
with d�butantes a state equivalent
after several long highballs
and to her present coma it
began she had talked on
now like all the more popular girls
she had her own entourage
is half a dozen
of some other chosen beauty
several times she had
to his head his dull eyes fixed
an infinite spark on the floor before
very depressed he looked and
drunk but edith each
had averted her glance
all that seemed long ago her
was passive now her senses
lulled to trance like sleep only
be incapable of moral indignation
happily drunk she gasped and
m a li l
edith why peter you re
s a bum way of
when you re with

varied with a silly
smile darlin edith he
earnestly you know i love

merely wanted you to kiss
he added sadly his embarrassment
beautiful girl in whole worl
beautiful eyes like stars above

thought henry s office must be across
him a shimmering marvel
unconventional jaunty thing the idea

lady in hot dispute and opening the

glance around him in which
hesitated then she suddenly pulled
to her and kissed him
soft pulpy lips all right
said heavily i ll get my hat
when edith came out
the clear blue of the
night she found the
deserted the windows of the big shops
dark over their doors were
great iron masks until they
forty second street she
a commingled blur of lights
the all night restaurants
on sixth avenue the elevated a
of fire roared across the street between
street it was very quiet
her cloak close about her edith darted
the avenue she started
as a solitary man passed her
said in a hoarse whisper
bound kiddo she was reminded
and a dog had howled at her
in a minute she had reached her
a two story comparatively old
for her to make
a dark hall and after
then she was in
long low room furnished
many desks and hung on all
at different ends of
and writing by a solitary
the doorway and then both
lean and dark with black piercing eyes
very thick glasses they were
of the person to whom he
talking he put his hands on her
was at a dance across
his alertness gave way
to a habitual vagueness you oughtn
night though ought you the man
been looking at them
but at henry s beckoning gesture
approached he was loosely fat
and tie he gave the impression of
this is my sister said henry she
in to see me

bartholomew laughing that s pretty

at the sign why she demanded just
have to howl they
t have anybody with much initiative in
lead or they d

to edith you should have been

her skirts and uncovered slim silk sheathed
or do you disapprove
exasperated bent his dark eyes on her
criticizing you in any
edith not at all she paused
was standing at the window what
back edith jumped to her
and running over joined bartholomew at
window there s a lot
henry henry readjusted his shade but kept
go away in a minute they re
not even thinking of going away
turning the corner of sixth
the street lamp she
see that the sidewalk
in uniform some sober
enthusiastically drunk and over the
swept an incoherent clamor
shouting henry rose and
to the window exposed
tobacco plugs cigarette boxes and
pennies beat against the
the sounds of the racket
began floating up the
as the folding doors
up henry from down stairs in
lower hall their cries
now quite audible god
socialists pro germans boche lovers second
front come on we ll get the
the next five minutes
that the clamor burst
upon the three of
that there was a
drawn her back toward
door opened and an overflow
men were forced into the room
the leaders but simply those who
up late ain t you you an
the front where they wobbled fatuously
of them was short and dark the
was tall and weak of
he said the clamor faded into a
stillness punctuated with mutterings
he repeated his far away eyes
over the heads of the crowd
re injuring no one but yourselves by
in here to night do we look
rich men do we look like
fairness pipe down i
say you do say who s
lady friend buddy a man in
clothes who had been pawing
new overflow from the
full of men all closing around
pale little group at the back edith
weak chin was still in front the
the open window through which came a
breath of cool night air then
that the soldiers were surging forward glimpsed
instantly the lights went
and she felt the push of warm
under rough cloth and
ears were full of shouting and trampling
hard breathing a figure flashed by
out of nowhere tottered was edged sideways
of a sudden disappeared helplessly out
cry that died staccato on
bosom of the clamor by the
light streaming from the
backing on the area edith had
quick impression that it had been
tall soldier with tie weak
anger rose astonishingly in her
swung her arms wildly
blindly toward the thickest of the scuffling
heard grunts curses the muffled impact of
henry she called frantically henry then
was minutes later she felt
she heard a voice deep bullying authoritative
saw yellow rays of
fracas the cries became more scattered the
on and the room was full
policemen clubbing left and
the deep voice boomed
here now here now here
and then quiet down and get
door here now this is no way
of your own sojers got shoved
of the back window an killed hisself
called edith henry she beat wildly
her she brushed between
others fought shrieked and beat her way
and then looking up said disgustedly they
fools here now called the police captain
now here now ix
of any morning differs from its sisters
less than the width of their marble
a crowd of poor people with sleep
the corners of their eyes trying to
straight before them at their food so
hours earlier is quite unlike any childs
from portland oregon to
maine within its pale but sanitary
of chorus girls college boys debutantes rakes
de joie a not unrepresentative mixture
was unusually full over the
topped tables were bent the excited
were eating buckwheat cakes
utterly impossible for them to repeat in
same place four hours later almost the
at delmonico s except for
chorus girls from a
revue who sat at
off a little more make up after
mouse like figure desperately out
place watched the butterflies with a weary
curiosity but the drab figure was
exception this was the
after may day and celebration
but a little dazed must be
he had got himself from
fourth street to fifty
carrol key put in an
and driven off and then he
fifty ninth street the
rose had wandered to
circle and chosen the
for coffee and doughnuts he walked
airy inconsequential chatter and high pitched laughter
first he failed to understand but after
puzzled five minutes he realized that this
the aftermath of some gay
excited waiters bearing cakes
eggs aloft swore at him silently
to rose seated at the most inconspicuous
he became gradually aware after
from him with their
room the man was drunk he wore
dinner coat with a dishevelled
and shirt swollen by spillings of
and wine his eyes dim and blood
roved unnaturally from side
side his breath came
between his lips he s been
a spree thought rose the
pretty with dark eyes
feverish high color and she kept her
eyes fixed on her companion
the alertness of a hawk from time
time she would lean
whisper intently to him and
head heavily or by
particularly ghoulish and repellent wink
woman gave him a quick resentful
two of the most conspicuously hilarious of
promenaders who were on

where peter attempted to buy another dish
hash to take with him and throw
policemen but the commotion upon his exit
h h from every person

the color of a maxfield parrish moonlight
blue that seemed to press close upon
pane as if to crowd

of may dawn in this car
and mr out discussing with amazement the
of christopher columbus discussing with bewilderment
old gray faces of the early risers
skimmed palely along the street like blown
lake they were agreed on all things
the absurdity of the bouncer in
they were dizzy with
extreme maudlin happiness that the morning
awakened in their glowing
in living that they felt it should
peter making a megaphone with
hands and dean joined in with a
that though equally significant and
derived its resonance from
very inarticulateness yo ho yea
was a bus with a dark
cleaner who dodged escaped and
up a yell of look
you re aimin in a
to stare after them and
some party boys at forty ninth
peter turned to dean beautiful morning

like building in fifth avenue what
idea the taxi driver informed them
this was delmonico s this
somewhat puzzling they were forced to
several minutes to intense concentration
if such an order
been given there must have been a
coat suggested the taxi
that was it peter
overcoat and hat he had
them at delmonico s having decided
they disembarked from the taxi and strolled
the entrance arm in arm hey said

room doors the one
word in in big black letters and
one on the right hand door
finger what look at the
let s take em good idea probably
very rare an valuable signs probably come
handy peter removed the left hand sign
the door and endeavored to conceal it
his person the sign
of considerable proportions this was a matter
some difficulty an idea
dignified mystery he turned his back
displayed himself to the
dean he had inserted the sign in
vest completely covering his shirt front
effect the word in had
painted upon his shirt in
black letters yoho cheered dean mister
manner mister out he
advanced and shook hands again laughter
of mirth yoho we probably
to the commodore arm in arm
sallied out the door and
out a short dark soldier
pale and tired who had been wandering
along the sidewalk turned
though to address them but as they
bent on him glances
withering unrecognition he waited until they
at about forty paces chuckling
himself and saying oh boy
and over under his breath
delighted anticipatory tones mr
concerning their future plans
to bend curious eyes on the
obviously they were engaged
a discussion which afforded each
them intense amusement for
a fit of laughter would
arms interlocked they would bend nearly double
the commodore they exchanged a few spicy
with the sleepy eyed doorman navigated the
door with some difficulty
then made their way through a
an obscure table in
corner they studied the bill
fare helplessly telling over the items
each other in puzzled mumbles don
see any liquor here
audible but unintelligible repeat continued peter
upon bill of fare here said dean
let me handle him he turned
the waiter bring us
us he scanned the
the waiter looked doubtful bring it roared
in and mr out in chorus
waiter coughed and disappeared there was a
wait during which they
subjected without their knowledge
a careful scrutiny by
head waiter then the champagne arrived and
the sight of it
in and mr out became jubilant
their objecting to us having
the feat was too much for
it was impossible for
joint imaginations to conjure up a world
any one might object
the waiter drew the cork with
with pale yellow froth here s
mr in here s same to you
s mortifying said dean suddenly wha
mortifying the idea their objecting us
into laughter howled swayed rocked back and
in their chairs repeating the word
over and over to
more gorgeous minutes they decided
consulted his immediate superior and this discreet
be served their check was brought five
left the commodore and
their way through a curious staring
along forty second street
sudden cunning they rose to
occasion and traversed the lobby walking
and standing unnaturally erect once in
torn between intermittent convulsive
and sudden spasmodic discussions
them that it was now
o clock and a
idea was born in them that
lingered over the second bottle
of them had only to
the word mortifying to send them both
riotous gasps the dining
was whirring and shifting
a curious lightness permeated and rarefied the
air they paid their check
walked out into the
it was at this moment that the
doors revolved for the thousandth time that
and admitted into the lobby
was accompanied by a plain stout
obviously not an appropriate
at the top of the stairs this
encountered mr in and
her hilariously and making a
bow darling good morning
throw this man summarily out of
way scuse familiarity added peter as an
edith good morning he seized
inseparable mr in and mr out
out advanced and bowed
fact he advanced so
and bowed so low that he
his balance by placing a hand
misterin misterout smisterinanout said peter proudly
edith stared straight by
her eyes fixed on some infinite
in the gallery above her
nodded slightly to the stout man who
bull like and with a sturdy brisk
to either side through this
farther on edith stopped again
and mr out in
with a sort of puzzled spell bound
there cried edith see
her voice rose became somewhat shrill
who broke my brother s leg
cutaway coat left his place
spring toward the short dark soldier
from the sight of mr
mr out this event was merely
particolored iridescent segment of a whirring spinning
they heard loud voices they saw the
man spring the picture suddenly blurred
they were in an
mr in top floor said mr out
is the top floor
the elevator man have another
put on said mr
higher said mr in heaven
a small hotel just off sixth avenue
sterrett awoke with a pain
he looked at the dusky
shadows in the corners of the
and at a raw place on
large leather chair in the
in use he saw clothes dishevelled
cigarette smoke and stale
the windows were tight shut outside the
sunlight had thrown a dust
wooden bed in which
comatose drugged his eyes
after he perceived the sunbeam with
dust on it and
rip on the large leather chair
him and it was another thirty
after that before that he
that he was irrevocably married to
hour later and bought
revolver at a sporting goods store then
to the room where he had been
on east twenty seventh

cartridge into his head just behind

at his feet and
ship on a crimson ocean a

distracted by one of the
porcelain bath tub it has character

1 john t unger came from
family that had been
john s father had held the amateur
unger was known from hot box to
john t unger who had just turned
york before he put
long trousers and now for a certain
respect for a new
education which is the bane
them yearly of their most
nothing would suit them but that he
small to hold their
know if you ever
very little the inhabitants have
keeping up to date in
depend to a great extent on hearsay
a function that in
would be considered elaborate would
perhaps a little tacky
t unger was on the eve
departure mrs unger with maternal fatuity packed
trunks full of linen suits and
son with an asbestos
book stuffed with money remember you
always welcome here he
don t forget who you
and where you come
continued his father proudly and you
do nothing to harm you
are an unger from hades so
old man and the young shook hands
john walked away with tears
had passed outside the
limits and he stopped to glance back
the last time over the gates
old fashioned victorian motto seemed strangely
time again to have
push and verve about it
as hades your opportunity or else
plain welcome sign set
lights the old motto was a little
mr unger had thought but
and then set his face resolutely toward
the lights of hades against the
st midas s school is half
distance will never be known
one ever will again st midas
is the most expensive and the
s first two years
boys were money kings and
of all the boys he visited
much of a piece and
his boyish way he often
at their exceeding sameness
he told them where his
was they would ask jovially
hot down there and
been heartier had they not all
with is it hot enough for you
there which he hated just as much
been put in john
his manner and exceedingly well dressed even
st midas s but for
reason he kept aloof
with whom he was intimate was
t unger but even to john he
or his family that he was
such deductions john knew
of his friend so it promised rich
for his curiosity when percy invited
they were in the train that percy
for the first time rather communicative one
while they were eating
in the dining car and discussing the
characters of several of the
at school percy suddenly changed his
the world oh said
politely he could think of no
to make to this confidence he considered
s very nice but it
of saying really but refrained
it would seem to question
s statement and such an astounding statement
repeated percy i was reading
the world almanac began john
incomes of over three million a year
oh they re nothing percy
them out and not know
does he why haven
they put down his
at least he pays a little one
he doesn t pay
very rich said john simply i
people the richer a
easter vivian schnlitzer murphy had rubies as
were like globes with lights inside them
school to know about it but i
got quite a collection myself
used to collect them
of stamps and diamonds
john eagerly the schnlitzer
had diamonds as big
forward and dropped his voice
a low whisper that s
at all my father has a
bigger than the ritz
hotel 2 the montana
from which dark arteries spread themselves
under the sky crouched the village of
men so it was said in
village of fish twelve
and inexplicable souls who sucked
had become a race apart these twelve
of fish like some species developed by
early whim of nature which on
thought had abandoned them to struggle
long line of moving
upon the desolation of the land and
twelve men of fish gathered
watch the passing of the seven
clock train the transcontinental express from
express through some inconceivable
this occurred a figure or
of the dusk and drive
toward the bruised sunset
observation of this pointless and preposterous phenomenon
become a sort of cult among
men of fish to
that was all there remained in
have grown up around these mysterious
but the men of fish were
that barren rock so there was no
no priest no sacrifice only each night
prayer of dim anaemic
on this june night the
brakeman whom had they deified
their celestial protagonist had ordained that the
o clock train should leave
and john t unger disembarked hurried
the spellbound the agape
fearsome eyes of the twelve men
fish mounted into a buggy which had
appeared from nowhere and drove away after
dark the silent negro
was driving the buggy
an opaque body somewhere ahead of them
disc which regarded them like a
eye out of the unfathomable night
they came closer john saw that it
the tail light of an
any he had ever
hubs of the wheels were
green and yellow john did not dare
beside the car and as
two young men dismounted from
the guest could not
negro s dialect get in
their trunks were tossed to the
roof of the limousine sorry we had
bring you this far in that
but of course it
t do for the
fellas in fish to see this automobile
what a car this ejaculation
provoked by its interior john saw
thousand minute and exquisite
of silk woven with jewels
embroideries and set upon a
of cloth of gold the two armchair
covered with stuff that resembled duvetyn
seemed woven in numberless colours
the ends of ostrich feathers what a
cried john again in amazement this thing
laughed why it s just an old
we use for a station wagon by
time they were gliding
through the darkness toward the break
i may as well tell you
s not going to be like
you ever saw before
the car was any indication
what john would see he
simple piety prevalent in
has the earnest worship
and respect for riches as the first
had now reached and were entering the
moon shone down here
gulch said percy trying to
out of the window
spoke a few words
the mouthpiece and immediately the footman
on a searchlight and
you see an ordinary car would be
to pieces in half
uphill now they were obviously ascending
within a few minutes the car
crossing a high rise where they caught
glimpse of a pale moon
car stopped suddenly and several figures
shape out of the
beside it these were negroes also again
four immense cables dangling from overhead
attached with hooks to the
of the great jewelled wheels
a resounding hey yah john felt
ground up and up
of the tallest rocks on both
rocks that they had just left only
one side was there still rock and
or anywhere around it was apparent
they had surmounted some immense knife blade
stone projecting perpendicularly into the air in
they were landed upon the smooth
percy squinting out the window it
only five miles from here and
own road tapestry brick all the
this belongs to us this is
the united states ends father says
we re in the
you are now on the
five square miles of
in the country that s never
surveyed why hasn t
did they forget it no said percy
the first time my grandfather corrupted a
department of the state survey
second time he had
official maps of the
for fifteen years the
that their compasses were in the
up he had a whole set of
instruments made with a slight
appear and he substituted them
the ones that were to be used
he had a river deflected and
had what looked like a village
a town ten miles farther up the
there s only one thing
one thing in the world that could
used to find us out what s
percy sank his voice to
whisper aeroplanes he breathed
ve got half a dozen anti
far but there ve been a
deaths and a great many prisoners not
mother and the girls and there s
t be able to arrange
passing the green moon like
john that it was
and that he was
at some lads sailing above him
hope for despairing rock bound hamlets
seemed to him that he could
them look down out of
there was to stare
what then were they induced to land
some insidious device to
until the judgment day or
they fail to fall into the
smoke and the sharp round
to earth and upset percy s
head and the wraith of
hollow laugh issued silently from his parted
terrible and golden mystery
chinchilla clouds had drifted past now and
the montana night was bright
smooth to the tread
pungent and cool then they came
into a broad avenue of lawn
john s exclamation of
was simultaneous with percy s
light of the stars an exquisite ch�teau
from the borders of
lake climbed in marble radiance half
height of an adjoining mountain then
translucent feminine languor into the massed darkness
towers the slender tracery
their oblongs and hectagons and triangles
tallest the blackest at its base
arrangement of exterior lights at the top
a sort of floating fairyland
faint acciaccare sound of violins drifted
in a rococo harmony that was like
he had ever beard
then in a moment
car stepped before wide high marble steps
which the night air was fragrant with
host of flowers at
top of the steps two
arms toward them mother percy was
hades afterward john remembered
a voice in love and of
and motions and faces there was a
haired man who stood drinking
many hued cordial from
crystal thimble set on
flowery face dressed like titania with braided
in her hair there was a
where the solid soft gold of the
a room that was like a platonic
of the ultimate prison ceiling floor and
unbroken mass of diamonds diamonds of
tail violet lamps in the corners it
the eyes with a
of these rooms the two boys wandered
would flame in brilliant patterns from
below patterns of barbaric clashing
of pastel delicacy of sheer whiteness or
inhabited by vivid fish and growths
rainbow foliage then they
be treading on furs of every texture
colour or along corridors of
ivory unbroken as though
complete from the gigantic
of dinosaurs extinct before the age
man then a hazily remembered transition
they were at dinner where each plate
of two almost imperceptible layers of
filigree of emerald design a
sliced from green air music
and unobtrusive drifted down through
curved insidiously to his back seemed to
glass of port he tried drowsily to
a question that had been
him but the honeyed luxury that
his body added to
illusion of sleep jewels fabrics wines and
blurred before his eyes into a sweet
yes he replied with a
effort it certainly is hot enough
me down there he managed to
and away leaving an iced dessert
be called a light his
host was standing over
you fell asleep at
percy was saying i
did too it was such a
year of school servants undressed and bathed
while you were sleeping is this
i want to apologise
what for doubting you
you said you had a diamond as
i thought you didn t
know what mountain the mountain the chateau
on it s not very big for
mountain but except about
cubic mile without a
aren t you listening say but john
unger had again fallen asleep 3
had slid aside on a sort of
leaving his chamber half open to the
a large negro in a
good evening muttered john summoning his brains
you ready for your bath
oh don t get up
ll put you in if you
john lay quietly as
pyjamas were removed he was amused
child by this black gargantua
was tending him but nothing of the
happened instead he felt the bed tilt
slowly on its side he began to
startled at first in
direction of the wall but when he
way and sliding two yards farther down
fleecy incline he plumped gently into
the same temperature as his body
had been projected into
chamber and was sitting in
above the level of the floor
room and the sides
bottom of the bath itself was
blue aquarium and gazing
the crystal surface on which
sat he could see
swimming among amber lights
even gliding without curiosity past his outstretched
which were separated from them only by
thickness of the crystal from
green glass i suppose sir that
cold salt water to finish the negro
smiling inanely as you please any idea
own meagre standards of living would
been priggish and not a little
the negro pressed a button
a warm rain began to fall
from a fountain arrangement
by the water turned to a pale
colour and jets of liquid soap
at the corners of
bath in a moment a dozen
paddle wheels fixed to the
radiant rainbow of pink
lightness and burst in
about him shall i
on the moving picture machine sir suggested
negro deferentially there s a good one
comedy in this machine to day
i can put in a serious
prefer it no thanks answered john
too much to desire
distraction but distraction came in a
he was listening intently to
sound of flutes from just
flutes dripping a melody that
cold fresh finish he stepped
a couch covered with the same
he was rubbed with oil
a voluptuous while he was
percy is waiting in your
room said the negro
these operations were finished my name
to mr unger every morning john
out into the brisk sunshine of his
kid knickerbockers smoking in an easy
4 this is a
of the washington family as percy sketched
of the present mr washington had been
of the civil war he was a
a played out plantation
norman culpepper washington for that
the young colonel s name decided
present the virginia estate to
him and bought twenty
tickets to the west where he
to take out land in their names
start a sheep and cattle
when he had been
montana for less than a
stumbled on his great discovery he had
sides and bottom of
gazing through the crystal surface on which
among amber lights and even gliding
from them only by the thickness of
sea green glass i suppose
that you d like hot
and soapsuds this morning sir and

and jets of liquid soap spurted into
from four miniature walrus heads
radiant rainbow of pink foam which
him softly with its delicious lightness
burst in shining rosy bubbles here and
on the moving picture machine sir suggested
negro deferentially there s a good
i can put in a serious
in a moment if you prefer
was enjoying his bath too much
the sound of flutes from just outside
dripping a melody that was
a waterfall cool and
as the room itself accompanying a frothy
in play more fragile than
lace of suds that covered
salt water bracer and a cold fresh
he stepped out and into a fleecy
and spice later he sat in a

sitting room said the negro when these
sir i am to see
mr unger every morning john
out into the brisk sunshine
for him and percy
in white kid knickerbockers smoking in an
chair 4 this is a story
father of the present mr washington
been a virginian a direct descendant
george washington and lord baltimore
the close of the civil war
with a played out
in gold fitz norman culpepper washington for
to present the virginia estate to his
brother and go west he selected
dozen of the most faithful blacks who
course worshipped him and bought twenty
tickets to the west where
intended to take out
in their names and start
indeed he stumbled on his great discovery
had lost his way when riding in
grow hungry as he was without
pursue a squirrel and in the
carrying something shiny in its mouth just
should alleviate his hunger it dropped
burden sitting down to consider the
fitz norman s eye was
lost his appetite and gained one
thousand dollars the squirrel which
refused with annoying persistence to
food had made him a
of a large and
diamond late that night
found his way to camp and
hours later all the males among his
were back by the
hole digging furiously at the side of
mountain he told them he had
one or two of them had ever
even a small diamond before they believed
him he found himself
but solid diamond he filled four
and started on horseback for
a dozen small stones when he tried
larger one a storekeeper fainted and
public disturber he escaped
jail and caught the train
few medium sized diamonds and
in exchange about two
thousand dollars in gold
he did not dare to produce any
circles not so much by the
of his diamonds as by their appearance
became current that a diamond mine
been discovered in the catskills on
jersey coast on long
men carrying picks and shovels began
leave new york hourly bound for various
el dorados but by
time young fitz norman was on
way back to montana by
estimated that the diamond in the mountain
approximately equal in quantity to all
rest of the diamonds known
exist in the world there was no
for it was one solid diamond
if it were offered for
not only would the bottom
the value should vary with its
in the usual arithmetical
of it and what could any
his secret should transpire
well as in jewels
institute a monopoly there
no alternative he must market his
in secret he sent south for his
brother and put him in charge
his coloured following darkies who had never
this he read them a proclamation
general forrest had reorganised
him implicitly they passed a vote
for foreign parts with one hundred thousand
all sizes he sailed for russia
a chinese junk and six months
his departure from montana he
obscure lodgings and called immediately
the court jeweller announcing that he
a diamond for the czar he remained
st petersburg for two weeks
and afraid to visit his
more than three or four
with larger and finer stones he
before he left however
fifteen million dollars under four different aliases
returned to america in 1868 having been
a little over two years he had
the capitals of twenty two countries
talked with five emperors eleven
a sultan at that
one billion dollars one fact worked
against the disclosure of his
week before being invested with
history of enough fatalities amours revolutions
wars to have occupied
his death in 1900 the history of
norman washington was a long epic
gold there were side issues of
married a virginia lady
and he was compelled due
a series of unfortunate complications to murder
brother whose unfortunate habit of
himself into an indiscreet stupor had
times endangered their safety but very other
stained these happy years
his outside wealth bought up
in the safety vaults
braddock tarleton washington followed
policy on an even
tensive scale the minerals were
into the rarest of all
be placed in a receptacle no
norman had been dead three
his son braddock decided
the business had gone
enough the amount of wealth that
of the mountain was
a note book in cipher in which
set down the approximate quantity
under which it was held
he sealed up the
what had been taken out
it would support all the washingtons yet
one care must be the protection of
he should be reduced
all the property holders in
the story he heard in his
walled living room the
after his arrival 5 after
john found his way out the great
scene before him the whole valley from
cliff five miles away
fine sweep of lawns and
and gardens here and
clusters of elms made delicate groves of
the hills in a grip of
he saw three fawns in single file
a half mile away and disappear with
of another john would not have been
to see a goat foot piping
a glimpse of pink nymph skin
flying yellow hair between
greenest of the green
in some such cool hope he descended
of two silky russian wolfhounds at
bottom and set off along a walk
he was enjoying himself as much
he was able it is youth
that it can never live in the
but must always be measuring
the day against its own
girls and stars they are only
with heavy scent and struck off
a park toward a
soft enough to justify
use of its name
an adjective then he saw a
coming toward him over the grass
was the most beautiful person he
ever seen she was dressed
her knees and a wreath of mignonettes
up her hair her
before them as she
she was younger than john not
was much more than that to john
he advanced toward her scarcely moving
he drew near lest he should tread
me said her soft voice her blue
added oh but you ve
jasmine last night i
sick with lettuce poisoning went
her soft voice and
made an enormous impression on
said john s eyes
how do you do said
you darling added his eyes
john observed that they
they sat down together upon the
the softness of which he
to determine he was critical about women
single defect a thick
in his life he
to him the incarnation of
perfection are you from
john simply i m
heard of hades or she
think of no pleasant
new york to miss bulge
it s very strict
i m going to live at home
to go walking two
two your father wants
to be proud observed
we are she answered
just got up and limped
was a young girl but

fashioned do you spend much time
percy and jasmine and i

out in london a year from this

you re much more sophisticated than i
no i m not
exclaimed hurriedly oh i
t think of being i
that sophisticated young people are terribly common
really if you say
am i m going
her lip was trembling john was impelled
protest i didn t mean that
because i wouldn t mind
m not i m very innocent and
i never smoke or drink
read anything except poetry

i scarcely dress at all i think
is the last thing you can
about me i believe that girls ought

him and a still born tear dripped
eye i like you
whispered intimately are you going
re here or will
be nice to me just think i
absolutely fresh ground i ve never
a boy in love with
in all my life i
where the family wouldn t
as he had been
d better go now
nowadays john drew himself up proudly
me girls don t do
sort of thing in hades side by
they walked back toward the
with a proud vacuous face intelligent
smelt of horses the best horses
carried a plain walking
of gray birch with a single large
for a grip he and
were showing john around the
quarters are there his walking stick indicated
cloister of marble on their left that
in graceful gothic along
was distracted for a while from the
idealism during that time they
of their rooms with a tile bath
suppose ventured john with an ingratiating
mr schnlitzer murphy are
little importance i should imagine interrupted
washington coldly my slaves did not keep
orders to bathe every day
they did if they hadn
i might have ordered
baths for quite another
several of them caught cold
died water is not good for
then decided to nod his head in
agreement braddock washington made
uncomfortable all these negroes are descendants
north with him there are
that they ve lived so long apart
the world that their original dialect has
an almost indistinguishable patois we
english my secretary and two or
golf course he continued as
strolled along the velvet
grass it s all
green you see no fairway no
no hazards he smiled pleasantly at
added after a moment we ve
difficulties mother was telling
exclaimed percy that italian
a ghastly error said
washington angrily but of course
s a good chance
we may have got him
woods or stumbled over a cliff and
that if he did get
ve had two dozen men
for him in different
around here and no
some fourteen of them reported to
was probably only the reward they
after he broke off
in the earth about the
of a merry go
and covered by a
iron grating braddock washington beckoned to
and pointed his cane down through
grating john stepped to the
and gazed immediately his ears were
by a wild clamor from below come
down to hell hallo kiddo how
throw us a rope got an
doughnut buddy or a
of second hand sandwiches say
you re with we ll
you a quick disappearance scene paste him
below but john could
from the coarse optimism
rugged vitality of the remarks
voices that they proceeded from middle
americans of the more spirited type
the scene below sprang into light these
discover el dorado he remarked
the earth shaped like
interior of a bowl the sides
steep and apparently of
stood about two dozen men clad in
half costume half uniform of aviators
upturned faces lit with
with malice with despair with cynical humour
covered by long growths of beard
with the exception of a few
had pined perceptibly away
seemed to be a
and sat down well
are you boys he inquired genially a
joined except a few
when its last echo had
from here and there among them
up there and we ll
us a way braddock washington waited
they were again quiet
he said i ve
you the situation i don t want
here i wish to
curiosity got you here and
time that you can think
a way out which protects me
my interests i ll be glad
your efforts to digging tunnels yes
you won t get
you as you make it
the loved ones at
if you were the type who
much about the loved ones at home
a tall man moved apart
minded man how absurd
could a man of
position be fair minded toward you
might as well speak of a spaniard
fair minded toward a piece
steak at this harsh observation the faces
the tall man continued all right
cried we ve argued this
you re human at least
say you are and you ought to
how how how what demanded washington coldly
unnecessary not to me
how cruel we ve covered that
there admitted washington i grant you
but try to think
an alternative i ve
to have all or any of
kidnapped and brought out
and feed and clothe you the
d have all of you operated on
us not to peach on you
some one you don t proffer that
seriously said washington with an expression of
i did take out
suddenly from two dozen
and wrestled with one another in
sudden uprush of animal spirits they
ran up the glass sides
they could and slid
to the bottom upon the natural
of their bodies the tall
ll hang the kaiser on
sour apple tree braddock
sat in inscrutable silence until the song
i bear you no ill
i like to see
enjoying yourselves that s why
didn t tell you
whole story at once the man what
his name critchtichiello was shot
places not guessing that
with a touch of
you expect me to take chances
any of you after an experience like
again a series of ejaculations went
to learn chinese hey i
speak italian my mother was
wop maybe she d like t learna
one with the big blue eyes i
and pushed the button in the
so that the picture below went
mouth covered dismally with the black
a single voice from
strolling on toward the
which his facile iron had
with ease 7 july under
lee of the diamond
was a month of blanket nights
of warm glowing days john
kismine were in love he
inscribed with the legend pro deo et
platinum chain next to her
but it did and she for
part was not aware that a large
which had dropped one day from her
coiffure was stowed away
in john s jewel box late
afternoon when the ruby and ermine
room was quiet they spent an hour
together he held her hand and
she bent toward him then hesitated
or she had wanted to be sure
it seemed to make little difference
afternoon drifted away that night when
last breath of music drifted down from
over the separate minutes of the day
had decided to be married as
mr washington and the two
men went hunting or fishing
the deep forests or played golf around
allowed his host to win
swam in the mountain coolness of the
personality utterly uninterested in any ideas
opinions except his own mrs washington
interminable conversations in rapid
kismine in appearance except that she
somewhat bow legged and terminated in
books had to do with poor girls
to start for europe as a canteen
taken steps to promote a new war
a photograph of some wounded
soldiers and lost interest
the whole proceedings but percy and
seemed to have inherited the
attitude in all its harsh magnificence
their father a chaste and consistent
idea john was enchanted by the wonders
the ch�teau and the valley braddock washington
percy told him had caused to be
a landscape gardener an
and a french decadent poet left
his entire force of negroes
and left them to work
but one by one they
shown their uselessness the decadent poet
apes and ivories but said nothing
on his part wanted
and sensational effects a state of
that the washingtons would
have grown tired of and
for the architect and the
of convention they must
but they had at least
to be done with them
an insane asylum at westport connecticut
all your wonderful reception rooms
man we found who was
to playing with an unlimited
of money though he did tuck
napkin in his collar
that he must soon go
to school he and kismine had
nicer to be married here
confessed but of course
permission to marry you at all
elope it s terrible for wealthy
present they always have
send out bulletins to the press saying
when what they mean is just
peck of old second
was visiting the schnlitzer murphys
eldest daughter gwendolyn married a man whose
owns half of west virginia
tough struggle she was carrying on
his salary as a bank clerk
then she ended up
good maids anyhow and that
a little it s absurd commented kismine
of the millions and millions of people
of kismine s changed the face
the entire situation and threw
into a state of terror they
in their favourite grove and between kisses
was indulging in some romantic forebodings
sometimes i think we ll never marry
said sadly you re too wealthy
magnificent no one as rich as you
i should marry the daughter of some
to do wholesale hardware
from omaha or sioux city
be content with her half million
knew the daughter of a wholesale
man once remarked kismine
don t think you d have been
with her she was a
seemed to regret her
a few but aren
they d talk outside
to some extent to some extent she
something pleasanter he demanded what s
his great surprise kismine began to
whole t trouble i
qu quite attached to some
them so did jasmine but she kept
viting them anyway i couldn t
mean that they told and your father
them removed worse than
and jasmine kept writing them to come
they had such a
like so many sparrows
upon his spinal column
i ve told you and i shouldn
have she said calming suddenly
you mean to say that your father
them murdered before they
us to get all the pleasure
of them that we can
going crazy did you really admit that
shoulders we can t very well imprison
day and it s always been made
for jasmine and me because father
it done sooner than
expected in that way we avoided any
scene so you murdered them uh cried
it was done very nicely
and their families were always
that they died of scarlet
you kept on inviting them i didn
burst out kismine i
invited one jasmine did and they
had a very good
she d give them
nicest presents toward the last i
probably have visitors too
can t let such an inevitable
way of enjoying life while we
it think of how lonesome
d be out here
we never had any one
some of their best friends
cried john accusingly and so you
letting me make love
you and pretending to return
and talking about marriage
alive no she protested passionately not any
i did at first you were here
couldn t help that and i thought
last days might as well
pleasant for both of
love with you and and i m
you cried john ferociously much
fun with a man whom
oh why did i tell you
ve probably spoiled your whole good time
and we were really enjoying things when
trembled with anger i ve heard
enough of this if you
t any more pride and
than to have an
with a fellow that you know isn
much better than a corpse
a corpse she protested in
won t have you
nothing of the sort
did you said i
direction and a moment later the
bushes were parted displaying braddock washington whose
looking vacuous face were peering in
obvious disapproval nobody answered
gruffly kismine you ought to be to
me find you here when i
back then he bowed at
we can never meet any more
won t let me meet you he
set his mind at
upon that moreover don t
yourself that i m going
i have to gnaw a passage through
and on my way east
his i m going too you must
crazy of course i
going she interrupted impatiently
said quietly we ll
up with father and talk it
with him defeated john
a sickly smile very well
he agreed with pale
for her returned and
placidly on his heart
was his she would go with him
share his dangers he put
arms about her and kissed her
after all she loved
she had saved him in fact
the matter they walked
braddock washington had seen them together
had best depart the next night nevertheless
s lips were unusually dry
left lung he had to
considered a great joke
long after midnight john s body
darkness that were his open
he had heard a
far away sound that
on his memory clouded
uneasy dreams but the sharp noise
a turned knob a footstep a
he could not tell a hard
gathered in the pit of his stomach
his whole body ached
the moment that he strained agonisingly to
and he saw a vague figure standing
the door a figure only
limned and blocked in upon the
mingled so with the
of the drapery as to
pane of glass with a sudden
of fright or resolution john
the button by his bedside and the
moment he was sitting in the green
bath of the adjoining room
into alertness by the
which he knew led out on to
ivory landing of the second floor
door opened noiselessly a single crimson lamp
in a great dome above
for a moment john
appalled by the silent splendour
its gigantic folds and
sitting room swung open
three naked negroes into
wild terror toward the stairway another
other side of the corridor
john saw braddock washington standing in
lighted lift wearing a fur coat and
pair of riding boots which reached to
his rose colored pyjamas on the instant
three negroes john had never
any of them before
it flashed through his
that they must be the
toward john and turned
to the man in the
who burst out with
imperious command get in
hell then within the instant
cage the oblong of light was blotted
as the lift door
shut and john was again alone in
hall he slumped weakly down against
ivory stair it was apparent
petty disaster what was
had the negroes risen in
had the aviators forced aside the iron
of the grating or
the men of fish stumbled
through the hills and
valley john did not know he
a faint whir of air as the
whizzed up again and then a moment
as it descended it was
that percy was hurrying to
plan an immediate escape he waited
the lift had been silent for several
shivering a little with the
cool that whipped in
room and dressed himself
then he mounted a long
of stairs and turned down the corridor
room was open and the lamps
lighted kismine in an angora kimono stood
the window of the room in a
attitude and as john entered
room to him did you hear them
heard your father s slaves in my
she interrupted excitedly aeroplanes aeroplanes
that was the sound that woke
there re at least
dozen i saw one a few moments
dead against the moon
guard back by the cliff fired his
and that s what roused
we re going to
on them right away
they here on purpose yes it s
last word a succession
kismine uttered a little cry
a penny with fumbling
from a box on her dresser and
darkness she had blown out the
him we ll go
to the roof garden
watch it from there
a cape about her she
his hand and they
their way out the door it
and as she pressed the
that shot them upward he
his arms around her in the darkness
kissed her mouth romance had come to
star white platform above under the
moon sliding in and out
the patches of cloud that
below it floated a dozen dark
bodies in a constant circling course from
and there in the
flashes of fire leaped toward them
by sharp detonations kismine clapped her hands
pleasure which a moment later
at some prearranged signal began to
their bombs and the whole
attackers became concentrated upon the points where
anti aircraft guns were situated and one
them was almost immediately
to a giant cinder to lie
in a park of rose bushes
attack came on the eve of my
back by the pass i should now
stone dead i can t hear you
kismine intent on the
before her you ll
d better get out
they begin to shell
the negro quarters cracked asunder a geyser
flame shot up from under the
and great fragments of
marble were hurled as far
the borders of the lake there go
thousand dollars worth of
cried kismine at pre war prices so
her to leave the aim of the
was becoming more precise minute by minute
still retaliating it was obvious
hold out much longer come
cried john pulling kismine
arm we ve got to go do
jasmine she said as
added in a sort of childish
we ll be poor
ll be an orphan and
she stopped and raised her
impossible to be both together
john grimly people have found that out
i should choose to be free
preferable of the two
an extra caution you d better
the contents of your
two girls met john
the dark corridor and they descended to
main floor of the chateau passing for
a moment out on the terrace watching
a solitary gun was still
sent their thunderous fireworks in a circle
it until any chance shot might
the left and began to ascend
narrow path that wound like a garter
the diamond mountain kismine
to observe the wild
in the valley finally
make an escape when it
be necessary along a secret path laid
o clock when they attained their
the obliging and phlegmatic jasmine fell
to sleep immediately leaning against
ebb and flow of the dying battle
after four o clock the last remaining
gave out a clanging sound and
that the flying bodies were
closer to the earth
the planes had made certain
would land and the dark and
reign of the washingtons would be
with the cessation of the firing the
grew quiet the embers of
two aeroplanes glowed like the eyes
as it had been beautiful in
asleep it was long after
when he became aware of footsteps
he waited in breathless silence until
passed the vantage point he
there was a faint
was cold be knew that the dawn
the mountain and were inaudible then he
about half way to the steep summit
rock spread itself over
diamond beneath just before
his pace warned by
animal sense that there was life just
of him coming to
high boulder he lifted his head
was rewarded this is what he
the gray sky without sound
dawn came up out of the east
a gold green colour to
john watched his host remained for
upright the first yellow beam of
sun struck through the innumerable prisms
an immense and exquisitely chiselled diamond
a white radiance was kindled that glowed
caught and hardened under the
crowd to hear but there was
crowd only the vast silence of
mountain and the sky broken
faint bird voices down
the trees the figure on the
out there he cried in a
voice you there he paused his arms
uplifted his head held attentively
though he were expecting an answer
strained his eyes to see whether
the mountain but the mountain
bare of human life there was
sky and a mocking flute
wind along the treetops could
prayer oh you above there
this was no forlorn
if anything there was in it a
of monstrous condescension you there words too
uttered to be understood
listened breathlessly catching a phrase here
there while the voice
off resumed broke off again now strong
argumentative now coloured with a slow
on the single listener and as
was no doubt the diamond in the
to follow that john perceived after
time was the thread running
birth of christ for
while his discourse took the farm of
that which divinity had
to accept from men great churches
he would rescue cities from
lives and beautiful women and captive
sheep and goats harvests and cities whole
now he braddock washington
a treasure such as
before him had never dreamed of offer
up not in suppliance but in pride
continued getting down to specifications
greatest diamond in the world this
would be cut with many more
be shaped with the
of a stone no bigger
a fly many men would work
it for many years it would be
in a great dome of beaten
gates of opal and crusted sapphire
the middle would be hollowed
a chapel presided over
the eyes of any worshipper who lifted
his head from prayer and
this altar there would be slain
the amusement of the divine benefactor any
he should choose even
it should be the
and most powerful man alive in return
asked only a simple thing
be as they were yesterday at
so remain so very
his slaves once more restored to
whom he had ever needed to
whether he had made his bribe big
god had his price of course
was made in man s
so it had been
he must have his price
no cathedral whose building consumed many years
this pyramid he paused here
specifications and there was nothing
in his assertion that it would
cheap at the price he implied that
approached the end his sentences became
became short and uncertain and his
seemed tense seemed strained to
the slightest pressure or
of life in the spaces
him his hair had turned
white as he talked and
to the heavens like
prophet of old magnificently mad
as john stared in giddy fascination
place somewhere around him
for an instant as
in a gust of wind
sound of far away trumpets a sighing
the rustle of a great silken
for a time the whole
and far over the mountain there was
sun sent hot waves of yellow
that made its path bright
it the leaves laughed in the
and their laughter shook until
in fairyland god had
day then turning he saw
flutter of brown down by the
then another flutter then
like the dance of golden angels alighting
the clouds the aeroplanes had
to earth john slid off the
and ran down the side of the
to the clump of trees where
two girls were awake and
her feet the jewels
her pockets jingling a
for words they must get off the
without losing a moment he seized
silence they threaded the tree trunks
valley came no sound at all except
had gone about half a mile they
the park land and entered a
path that led over the next rise
ground at the highest point of this
paused and turned around their eyes rested
the mountainside they had
left oppressed by some dark sense of
descending the steep slope
a burden between them
half way down two other figures joined
john could see that they were
washington and her son
whose arm she leaned
aviators had clambered from their
to the sweeping lawn in front of
in skirmishing formation but the little
of five which had formed farther
and was engrossing all
of rock the negroes
and pulled up what appeared to be
trap door in the side of
mountain into this they
first then his wife and son finally
the sun for a moment before
trap door descended and engulfed them
wildly where are they
mountain is wired even as
his sight before their
mountain had changed suddenly to a
burning yellow which showed up through
jacket of turf as light
through a human hand for a moment
intolerable glow continued and then
an extinguished filament it
revealing a black waste from
there was left neither
nor bone they were consumed as
as the five souls
had gone inside simultaneously and
flaming fragments as it rose and then
back upon itself in a smoking pile
what smoke there was
off mingling with the sunshine
a powdery dust of marble drifted
been the house of
three people were alone
two companions reached the huge cliff
the washington s dominion and looking back
the valley tranquil and lovely in the
it don t they look tempting
jasmine enters the middle class now said
eagerly turn out your
and let s see what jewels you
along if you made a
comfortably all the rest of our lives
kismine put her hand in
pocket and tossed two
of glittering stones before
not so bad cried john enthusiastically they
changed as he held
of them up to the declining
a startled look what an idiot i
she broke into a
i opened the wrong drawer they belonged
jasmine i got her to give
i d never seen anything but
stones before and this
what you brought i
afraid so she fingered the
wistfully i think i like
better i m a little
gloomily we ll have
live in hades and you will grow
the wrong drawer unfortunately your father
bank books were consumed with him well
s the matter with
if i come home with
off with a hot coal
i love washing she
my own handkerchiefs i
do they have washwomen in hades asked
innocently of course answered john
thought perhaps it was too
try it he suggested they
re half started will father
there she asked john turned to her
replied sombrely why should he go to
you have it confused with another place
was abolished long ago after
what a dream it was
one dress and a penniless
i never noticed the stars
i always thought of them as great
diamonds that belonged to some one
they frighten me they make me feel
quietly everybody s youth is a dream
form of chemical madness how pleasant then
be insane so i m told said
divine drunkenness that we can all try
whole world diamonds and perhaps
it he shivered turn up
s full of chill and you
great sin who first invented
let us lose it for a
hours so wrapping himself in his
he fell off to
the curious case of benjamin button i
long ago as 1860
i am told the high
first cries of the young shall
uttered upon the anaesthetic air of
hospital preferably a fashionable one

than was expected from a southern gentleman

gazing at a man of threescore and

of roger button s

he was to make a
his own age he was not

decided that his hair needed a new
of its brown dye but an
inspection of his bureau drawer disclosed

before and thrown it

there seemed to be

undergraduates benjamin walked away
he was not fated to escape so
on his melancholy walk to the
station he found that he was being
finally by a dense
of undergraduates the word
gone around that a lunatic had passed
entrance examinations for yale and
a youth of eighteen a
ran hatless out of classes the football
abandoned its practice and joined
mob professors wives with
awry and bustles out of position
shouting after the procession from which proceeded
continual succession of remarks aimed at the
wandering jew he ought to go
prep school at his
look at the infant prodigy he thought
up to harvard benjamin increased his
and soon he was running
to harvard and then they would
on board the train for
the undergraduates laughed ha ha
it was the biggest mistake that yale
had ever made 5 in 1880 benjamin
he signalised his birthday
that is his father insisted on taking
to several fashionable dances roger
and his son were more and
companionable in fact since benjamin
ceased to dye his hair which was
grayish they appeared about the
age and could have passed for
one night in august they got into
phaeton attired in their full dress suits
drove out to a dance
was a gorgeous evening a full moon
the road to the lustreless colour
were like low half heard
with bright wheat was translucent
in the day it
almost impossible not to be affected by
in the dry goods business
a spiritual man his aesthetic sense was
old fellows like me can
learn new tricks he observed profoundly it
you youngsters with energy and vitality that
the great future before you far up
road the lights of the shevlins
house drifted into view
presently there was a
of violins or the rustle
pulled up behind a handsome brougham
gentleman then another young lady beautiful
passed over him blood rose into
a steady thumping in
ears it was first love the girl
slender and frail with hair that was
under the moon and
coloured under the sputtering gas lamps of
porch over her shoulders was thrown
spanish mantilla of softest yellow butterflied in
of her bustled dress roger button leaned
the daughter of general
thing he said indifferently but when
negro boy had led the buggy away
her they approached a
of which miss moncrief was the centre
benjamin yes he might
a dance he thanked her and walked
staggered away the interval until
time for his turn should arrive dragged
to the wall silent inscrutable watching with
baltimore as they eddied around hildegarde
passionate admiration in their
how obnoxious they seemed
of the latest waltz
hesitated if she took him for
father s brother would it be best
enlighten her he remembered his experience
be rude to contradict
are so idiotic they tell
how to appreciate women benjamin felt himself
the verge of a proposal
re just the romantic
she continued fifty twenty
is too wordly wise
is apt to be pale from
forty is the age of long stories
take a whole cigar
be fifty i ve
said went on hildegarde that i
rather marry a man
fifty and be taken care of
many a man of thirty
take care of him
benjamin the rest of the evening was
in a honey coloured
and they discovered that they were
in accord on all the questions of
day she was to go driving
would discuss all these
further going home in the phaeton
first bees were humming and the fading
our biggest attention after hammers and nails
elder button was saying love replied
absent mindedly lugs exclaimed roger button
i ve just covered the
of lugs benjamin regarded him with dazed
six months later the engagement of
hildegarde moncrief to mr benjamin button
moncrief declared he would
announce it the excitement
baltimore society reached a feverish pitch
almost forgotten story of benjamin
birth was remembered and sent out upon
winds of scandal in picaresque and
forms it was said that benjamin was
the father of roger
that he was his
had two small conical horns sprouting
his head the sunday
played up the case with fascinating sketches
showed the head of benjamin button
to a fish to a
and finally to a body
as the mystery man of maryland but
true story as is usually the
had a very small
however every one agreed with general moncrief
it was criminal for a lovely
who could have married any beau
the arms of a man who was
fifty in vain mr
one believed it you had only
look at benjamin and
on the part of the two
so many of the stories about
fianc� were false that
refused stubbornly to believe even the
one in vain general moncrief pointed out
her the high mortality among
looked fifty in vain he told her
hildegarde had chosen to marry for
and marry she did
hildegarde moncrief were mistaken the wholesale hardware
1895 the family fortune was
and this was due largely to the
member of the firm needless to say
son in law when benjamin gave
the money to bring out
history of the civil
refused by nine prominent publishers
changes it seemed to him
be a pleasure to
in the morning to walk with an
it was in 1890
up the boxes in which
are shipped are the
of the shippee a proposal which
a statute was approved by chief
and company wholesale hardware more than
of life it was
of his growing enthusiasm for pleasure that
was the first man
the city of baltimore
own and run an automobile meeting him
the street his contemporaries would
and vitality he seems to
remark and if old roger button now
five years old had failed at
at last by bestowing on him
will be well to pass over as
as possible there was only one thing
worried benjamin button his wife
with a son roscoe
years old in the
days of their marriage
had worshipped her but as the years
her honey coloured hair became an
brown the blue enamel of her eyes
most of all she had
it been she who had dragged benjamin
dances and dinners now conditions
without enthusiasm devoured already by that eternal
which comes to live with each of
one day and stays with
to the end benjamin s discontent
stronger at the outbreak of
home had for him so little charm
he decided to join
army with his business influence he obtained
so adaptable to the
that he was made a
and finally a lieutenant
celebrated charge up san juan hill
benjamin had become so attached
the activity and excitement of array
resigned his commission and came
he was met at the station
a brass band and escorted to his
8 hildegarde waving a large
flag greeted him on the porch and
as he kissed her he
with a sinking of the
that these three years had taken
toll she was a
of forty now with a faint
her head the sight
he went closer and examined his
like a man of thirty instead
was growing younger he
hitherto hoped that once he
a bodily age equivalent
function he shuddered his destiny seemed
him she appeared annoyed and
wondered if she had
the matter at dinner in
well he remarked lightly
sniffed do you think it
moment i should think you d
enough pride to stop it
going to argue with
of doing things and
up your mind to be different from
you but i really don t think
s very considerate but
i can t help
you can too you
to be like any
but just think how it would
if every one else looked at things
you do what would the world be
as this was an inane and unanswerable
from that time on
them he wondered what
any kind in the city
baltimore but he was there
women chatting with the
of evil omen sat among the
now in haughty disapproval and now following
with solemn puzzled and reproachful
a young fellow that age tied to
woman of forty five he must be
years younger than his wife
that back in 1880
mammas and papas had also remarked about
growing unhappiness at home was compensated for
and made a great success of
he went in for dancing in 1906
was an expert at the boston
castle walk was the envy
of course interfered to some
with his business but then he had
hard at wholesale hardware for twenty
it on to his son roscoe
had recently graduated from harvard
and his son were in fact often
for each other this pleased benjamin he
forgot the insidious fear which
from the spanish american
na�ve pleasure in his appearance there was
one fly in the delicious
public with his wife hildegarde was
fifty and the sight of her made
feel absurd 9 one september day
1910 a few years after
button co wholesale hardware had been
over to young roscoe button
man apparently about twenty
at harvard university in cambridge he did
he would never see fifty again
did he mention the fact that
almost immediately attained a prominent
in the class partly because
seemed a little older
age was about eighteen but his
that he scored seven touchdowns and fourteen
from the field unconscious he was
say in his third or
year he was scarcely
to make the team the coaches
that he had lost
and it seemed to
more observant among them that he was
quite as tall as before he
no touchdowns indeed he was retained on
team chiefly in hope that his
reputation would bring terror and disorganisation to
yale team in his
year he did not
the team at all he had grown
slight and frail that one
a freshman an incident which
him terribly he became known
than sixteen and he was
of his classmates his studies seemed
to him he felt
his classmates speak of st midas s
and he determined after his
to enter himself at
midas s where the
upon his graduation in 1914 he
his pocket hildegarde was now residing in
in a general way there was obviously
him there was even perceptible a
on his son s part to
that benjamin as he moped
in the way roscoe was married now
four fifteen year old boys in
neighbourhood his idea of going to
midas s school recurred to
replied roscoe shortly the
was distasteful to him and
wished to avoid a discussion
can t go alone said benjamin
you ll have to enter me
got time declared roscoe abruptly his eyes
and he looked uneasily at his father
better you better he paused
for words you better turn right around
start back the other
funny any longer you you
yourself benjamin looked at
and another thing continued roscoe
not roscoe but uncle do you understand
d better call me
all the time so
look at his father
turned away 10 at the termination
this interview benjamin wandered
upstairs and stared at
in the mirror he had
shaved for three months
he could find nothing on his face
a faint white down with
it seemed unnecessary to meddle when
had first come home from
roscoe had approached him
wear eye glasses and imitation whiskers glued
his cheeks and it had seemed for
years was to be repeated but whiskers
wept and roscoe had
relented benjamin opened a
but he found himself thinking
allied cause during the preceding
was the minimum age and
did not look that old
true age which was fifty
there was a knock at
door and the butler
with a letter bearing a large official
in the corner and addressed to mr
and read the enclosure with delight
informed him that many
officers who had served in the spanish
a higher rank and it enclosed
commission as brigadier general in
united states army with
minutes later he had
a large tailoring establishment on charles
and asked in his uncertain treble to
measured for a uniform want to
soldier sonny demanded a clerk casually benjamin
say never mind what i want he
angrily my name s button and i
m good for it well admitted the
hesitantly if you re
benjamin was measured and a week later
uniform was completed he had difficulty in
the proper general s insignia
benjamin that a nice
w c a badge would look just
he left the house
night and proceeded by train to
mosby in south carolina
he was to command an
paid off the taxicab
had brought him from
station and turned to the sentry
guard get some one to handle
eyed him reproachfully say
remarked where you goin with
general s duds sonny benjamin veteran
with fire in his
but with alas a changing
voice come to attention he tried
his heels together and bring his
to the present benjamin concealed a
of gratification but when he glanced
his smile faded it was
he who had inspired
but an imposing artillery colonel who
approaching on horseback colonel called benjamin
the colonel came up drew rein and
coolly down at him with a twinkle
he demanded kindly i ll soon darn
show you whose little boy i
get down off that
the colonel roared with laughter you
this and he thrust his commission toward
colonel the colonel read
you get this he demanded slipping
document into his own pocket i got
a peculiar look we
go up to headquarters and talk this
come along the colonel
and began walking his horse in the
for benjamin to do but
himself a stern revenge but this
did not materialise two days later however
son roscoe materialised from
hot and cross from
hasty trip and escorted the
in 1920 roscoe button
the attendant festivities however no one
little grubby boy apparently
around the house with
soldiers and a miniature circus was
new baby s own grandfather no
face was crossed with just
hint of sadness but to roscoe button
presence was a source of torment in
idiom of his generation roscoe did
curious and perverse manner indeed to think
the matter for as much as
half an hour drove him to the
of insanity roscoe believed that live wires
keep young but carrying it out
inefficient and there roscoe rested five
coloured paper making mats and
and curious and beautiful designs was the
fascinating game in the world once
was bad and had to stand in
room with the sunlight coming in the
tousled hair roscoe s son
was very happy sometimes when
tots talked about what they would
in which he was never
share the days flowed on
monotonous content he went
a third year to
kindergarten but he was too
now to understand what the
shining strips of paper
bigger than he and he was afraid
them the teacher talked
him but though he tried to
kindergarten his nurse nana
centre of his tiny world on bright
and say elephant and benjamin would
being undressed for bed that
he would say it over
elyphant sometimes nana let him jump on
bed which was fun because
you sat down exactly right
ah for a long time
you jumped you got a very
go around hitting chairs
tables with it and saying
the old ladies would cluck at him
interested him and the
ladies would try to kiss him which
submitted to with mild boredom and when
five o clock he would

with a spoon there were no
memories in his childish
no token came to

eyes burned like great
letters he had drawn a chair close

awoke with what was nearly a scream
find the fog thick in
room and his guest a gray ghost
a pile of paper in his
may i ask you
like stuff from a
inverted bottle upon a
in the corner slept
in a curious and somewhat uncanny manner
the scrawled uncertain first page he began
aloud very softly the

trustless wings of false desire lust breathing

rather was a very
red and orange posters
breathless exotic intent and lit
bindings of special editions than by
lighted through all the day swung overhead
the door in a
of serpentine embroidery the windows seemed always
deep orange which offer their
on little white paper squares and
which the clever inscrutable mr moonlight quill
to be sprinkled about
smell half of a
coffee house on the
shores of the bosphorus from
until five thirty merlin
or were interested in first editions did
buy novels with arabs on the
newest sonnets as dictated psychically to miss
of south dakota he
as a matter of fact
own taste ran to these
but as an employee at the moonlight
he assumed for the working day the
of a disillusioned connoisseur
he had crawled over the window
to pull down the
shade at five thirty every afternoon and
good bye to the mysterious
moonlight quill and the lady
miss mccracken and the
stenographer miss masters he
home to the girl caroline he
his bureau with the collar buttons
near the cottage cheese and the
never asked her to eat with him
delicatessen on sixth avenue and
a box of crackers a
of anchovy paste and some oranges
else a little jar
a bottled soft drink
with these in a brown package he
and gay person who
in that she never existed
six and she disappeared at the latest
midnight her apartment was a
one in a nice building with a
stone front opposite the south
grainger he called her
because there was a picture
young man of twenty
with dark hair and no mustache
beard or anything like that but
was dazzling and light with a shimmering
of russet waves to take
that remind you of
the sort of features you
belonged to your first
across an old picture didn t she
a slender black gown that
a certain place on the wall
merlin thought most be a mirror
back and smoked a
merlin considered very graceful at
time she had come to
looked out because the
had lost its way and was dripping
strangest and most transforming brilliance
the areaway between turning the motif of
cans and clothes lines into a
impressionism of silver casks
gigantic gossamer cobwebs merlin was
in plain sight eating cottage cheese
the window cord that
tipped the cottage cheese
his lap with his free
and the milk was cold and the
made spots on his trousers
after all sometimes there were
men in dinner coats who stood
on arm as they talked to
then bowed some more
a dance other young men came
to tell caroline something she sitting
in the profile chair and
them with eager intentness or else
the chaise longue by
calls of some of the men
approved others won only his
toleration one or two he loathed
with black hair and
but whom he was
quite able to recognize now merlin s
life was not bound
he never arrived in time to
marry her a much stranger
is this strange thing that will
be set down here
briskly into the mellow
of the moonlight quill
world and done in that particularly gloomy
down the streets whisking along battered newspapers
pieces of things and little lights were
so desolate that one

least these were the sort of
that lay heavily upon the

out of the window
of the most distressing thoughts of the
boot of genesis of how thomas edison
would be no dwelling houses upon the
up turned and caroline walked coolly into
shop she was dressed in
jaunty but conventional walking costume he
her skirt was plaid pleated like
concertina her jacket was a
but brisk tan her shoes and spats
brown and her hat
candy box merlin breathless and
advanced nervously toward her good
not know except that it
to him that something very
occur and that it
in that minute before the thing
of a breathless second hanging
in time he saw
office the malevolent conical head
his employer mr moonlight quill bent
his correspondence he saw miss
with a touch of pleasure how really
and romantic it made the book
seem then the thing happened or
it began to happen caroline picked
a volume of poems lying loose
suddenly with an easy
tossed it upward toward the
silk as a dark bulging rectangle this
laughter in which merlin found
merrily it stayed up
voice was rich and full of
try another he found
this her laughter increased and
had to rest her hands
spasms of mirth oh
i ll choke if
don t stop laughing here it goes
a red book and sent it in
gentle hyperbola toward the ceiling where
sank into the lamp beside
first it was a few minutes before
of them could do more
rock back and forth in helpless
but then by mutual
they took up the sport anew this
applauding his own accuracy
took a best seller in one
and a book on barnacles
watching he found how supple
was in every movement sometimes one of
made shot after shot
up the nearest book sending it
glance before reaching for another within three
place on the table
bulging with books that it was
she cried scornfully as a book
he agreed she paused in the
of tossing a book and
got room to sit down now she
of nervousness merlin glanced toward mr
quill s glass partition but
had not seen what had
on in the shop
when caroline put her hands on
calmly imitated her and they sat
i had to see
she began with a rather
was that last time she
her voice trembling a little though
tried to keep it
i was frightened i don t like
ll swallow a collar button i did
almost he confessed reluctantly but it
not so easy you know
flat part easy enough or else
have a specially made throat he
remarks words seemed for the
time in his life
be used gathering themselves
carefully arranged squads and
and being presented to him by
adjutants of paragraphs that
had to have a specially made throat
nodded frankly i haven t it costs
this rather a delight in making the
least of all his poverty
it caroline looked down at
from the table to her feet
i didn t realize i have
be at the ritz at five
i ve got a bet on it
one accord they set
finally crashing through the glass
that housed mr moonlight quill the proprietor
up with a wild look
and went on with his letters
mccracken gave no sign
started and gave a little frightened scream
she bent to her task
of energy they were hurling book after
in all directions until sometimes three or
pictures on the walls falling in
was fortunate that no customers
to come in for it
certain they would never
come in again the noise was
tremendous a noise of smashing and
and tearing mixed now and then
quick breathing of the
of laughter to which both
thirty caroline tossed a last book at
the load it carried the
one vast splattering of white and color
the already littered floor then
a sigh of relief she turned
merlin and held out her hand
by she said simply are you
he knew she was his question was
a lingering wile to detain
and extract for another moment that dazzling
of light he drew from her
features which were like kisses
he thought like the features of
girl he had known back in
for a minute he pressed the
of her hand then she smiled
withdrew it and before he
out into the turbid and
seventh street i would like to
how beauty regards the wisdom of
years walked into the little partition
into the street a much finer and
merlin grainger stood up and surveyed
wreck of the bookshop
ruined volumes the torn silk remnants
the once beautiful crimson lamp
crystalline sprinkling of broken glass which lay
iridescent dust over the whole interior and
he went to a corner where
broom was kept and began cleaning
he was able restoring the shop
its former condition he found that though
few of the books were
most of them had suffered
varying extents the backs were off
the pages were torn from
cracked in the front which as all
book returners know makes a
o clock he had done much to
the damage he had returned the
sockets overhead the red shade itself
ruined beyond redemption and
the money to replace it might have
come out of his salary at
therefore having done the best he
he saw mr moonlight quill rise from
desk put on his overcoat and
and emerge into the
he nodded mysteriously at merlin and
the knob he paused turned around and
ferocity and uncertainty he said
that girl comes in here
you tell her to behave with
s meek yessir in its creak and
out merlin stood there
to worry about what was for
and invited miss masters to have
with him at pulpat s french restaurant
one could still obtain red wine at
miss masters accepted wine
me feel all tingly she
merlin laughed inwardly as
compared her to caroline or rather as
didn t compare her there was no
ii mr moonlight quill mysterious
of decision and it
with decision that he approached
problem of his wrecked shop unless he
make an outlay equal to the original
of his entire stock
he did not wish to
before there was but
thing to do he promptly turned his
five to fifty per cent the name
once shone so insolently bright was
to grow dim and take on
indescribably vague color of old paint
having a strong penchant for ceremonial
proprietor even went so far as
buy two skull caps of
red felt one for himself and
for his clerk merlin grainger moreover he
his goatee grow until
resembled the tail feathers of
miss masters miss mccracken
followed in the footsteps of mr moonlight
and become an intolerable
of his decay always a young
known as a pusher he had
manual training department of a
york high school an inveterate
of clothes hair teeth and even eyebrows
felt had won him
place in the greatest splendor of
moonlight quill it was due
them that he was
still making chests useful
the progressive moonlight quill became
sink with it and
took to letting his
gather undisturbed the wispy burdens
the air and to throwing
even into no drawer at
it was not uncommon in
clean clothes go directly back
been worn a common eccentricity
magazines which at that time were fairly
with articles by successful
against the frightful impudence
the condemned poor such as the
of wearable shirts and
saving banks it was
a strange state of affairs and a
one for many worthy
god fearing men for the first
chinese ubu and was only a thing
got back occasionally after paying for
soft drink and could
merely in getting your correct weight
a phenomenon as it at
seems it was too
that he did take the
almost involuntary step of
with vin ordinaire that the proposal
it you chattered miss masters gaily yes
merlin absently and then after a long
ll listen to me the tingliness of
it seemed that she would
be electrocuted by her
nervous reactions but her
merlin came without a sign or flicker
stray bit of air
no fortune he said with the manner
locked became wistful and dreamy and beautiful
he told her i love
i love you too merlin she answered
shall we have another bottle of wine
a great rate do you
to drink to our engagement
a short one no he almost
upon the table may it
forever what i mean
i see what you mean you re
may it be a short one he
and added my error
the wine arrived they discussed
matter thoroughly we ll
he said and i believe
by golly i know there s a
a big room and
and the use of
that is the upper part of her
from the bridge of the
down she was somewhat out of
she continued enthusiastically and as soon
take a real swell apartment with an
and a telephone girl and
that a place in the country
a car i can t imagine
more fun can you merlin fell silent
moment he was thinking that he
floor rear yet it
had never seen her for
week after that visit her lights had
the areaway seemed to grope
in at his expectant uncurtained
then the lights had
at last and instead of
and her callers they stowed a
rearranging bric � brac after two days
them merlin had callously pulled down his
nothing more fun than
in the world with olive
would be a cottage
class below the sort
cottages that are of white
with a green roof in
grass around the cottage would
rusty trowels and a broken green
a wicker body that sagged to
left and around the grass and
baby carriage and the cottage
arms of olive a little
say this to night merlin i could
she could see ah suddenly
see that the girl who had
in with a party
three men and sat down at the
table was caroline ah could she
that could she see
the men brought with
s red ink condensed threefold merlin stared
ice and the fine laughter of all
at some pleasantry and that laughter
caroline s that he knew so well
him lifted him called his heart imperiously
to her table whither it obediently went
could see her quite plainly and he
that in the last year and
half she had changed if ever
slightly was it the light
were her cheeks a little thinner and
eyes less fresh if more liquid
of old yet the
were still purple in her russet
her mouth hinted yet of kisses as
the profile that came sometimes between his
youth and wine and fine cosmetic
he could tell she was
old fellow opposite her for the
from time to time
generation merlin caught the
of a song she was
singing just snap your fingers at care
re there the portly
filled her glass with chill amber
and many helpless glances
questionnaire as to the succulence of
dish or that managed to obtain the
speaking to merlin when then she
her voice faintly shaded with disappointment he
that he had just answered no
oh sometime don t you care
rather pathetic poignancy in her question brought
eyes back to her as soon
two months in june so soon her
yes i think we d better say
no use waiting olive
to pretend that two months
really too short a time for her
make preparations wasn t he a
boy wasn t he
though well she d show him
mustn t be too quick with
he repeated sternly olive
finger lifted high above the
in true refined fashion a stray thought
to merlin that he would like
by gosh he exclaimed aloud soon
would be putting rings on
of her fingers his eyes
sharply to the right the
of four had become
approached and spoken to them
was arguing with this head
in a raised voice a
so clear and young that it
as though the whole
secret how do you do
captivity too much noise very unfortunate something
the head waiter says there s
much noise appeals to us to
it stopped what ll i say
and merlin heard him add in
undertone all the bourgeoisie will
learn french caroline sat up straight in
alertness where s a
for they all including caroline
into renewed laughter the
waiter after a last conscientious but
d h�te it is not a gay
in the conventional sense one comes
the red wine talks perhaps
little more and a
louder than usual under the low
ceilings and then goes
it closes up at nine thirty tight
a drum the policeman
extra bottle of wine
the missis the coat room girl
prepared for pulpat s
evening excitement of no mean
shadowed hair mounted to
table top and began
dance thereon sacr� nom
dieu come down off there
loud that they could pretend not
hear his order having once
young they played louder
of frenchmen at a table
by broke into cries
room was full of clapping and
half the diners were on their
crowding up and on the
the hastily summoned proprietor was giving indistinct
evidences of his desire to put an
to this thing as quickly as possible
cried olive awake aroused at last
let s get out now the
merlin protested feebly that the check was
on the table i despise
girl i can t bear
on her feet now tagging
merlin s arm helplessly listlessly and
with what amounted to downright unwillingness
rose followed olive dumbly as
and threatening to become a wild and
riot submissively he took his
light feet on the table
over the little world
not until next day that
told him about the
how she had moved the
of may iii and married they were
a somewhat stuffy manner under
chandelier of the flat where olive lived
her mother after marriage came
her twenty suffice to keep them
fat and to hide with decent garments
several weeks of disastrous and well nigh
delicatessen fed so he
up his old way
life again in that he stopped
evening at braegdort s delicatessen and
slices and sometimes even
obliterated design the hall had
ancient smell of the vegetables
1880 of the furniture
eve bryan ran against william mckinley
portieres an ounce heavier with dust
up the stairs revivified and made
cooking then as he began
next flight diminishing into the
room which slipped open with indecent
to night olive who
to get a morsel
air would be making the bed
hanging up things at his call
open eyes while be held her upright
two arms as though
were a thing without equilibrium and
once he relinquished hold
with the second year
marriage succeeding the bridegroom kiss
is rather stagey at
and apt to be copied
after that they went out for
central park or sometimes to a
they were the sort of people
whom life was ordered and that
very grand and brave and beautiful would
happen to them if they
docile and obedient to their rightful
and kept away from
such was their day for three
then change came into their lives
had a baby and as a result
had a new influx of material resources
the third week of olive s confinement
an hour of nervous
an enormous increase in salary i ve
do my best in the
put into effect a project long
he was going to retire
active work in the bookshop confining
fifty dollars a week and
one tenth interest in
finished merlin s cheeks were glowing
his eyes full of
he seized his employer
hand and shook it violently
over and over again it
very very nice of you
after ten years of
work in the store he
won out at last looking back he
of elation no longer as
sometimes sordid and always gray decade
worry and failing enthusiasm
the youth had faded out
olive s face but as
glorious and triumphant climb over
will power the optimistic self
was seen now in the
dozen times he had taken
to leave the moonlight quill and soar
but through sheer faintheartedness
that those were times
where he was at any
of himself he had
of importance he left the shop
evening fairly radiant invested every
homeward with the great news and four
too sick to eat that he
himself faintly but unmistakably ill
a struggle with four
all next day did not mar
lived under a sky of unclouded tranquillity
life became dignified significant and at
to a somewhat secondary place in
they regained in a
of primordial pride the
house did not come but a
in an asbury park
gap and during merlin s two weeks
merry jaunt especially when with
room opening technically on the
walk puffing at his cigar
trying to look like twenty thousand a
and the accelerating of the years
became thirty one thirty two
almost with a rush arrived at
age which with all its washing
bare handful of the precious stuff
and one day on fifth avenue he
easter morning and the avenue was
pageant of lilies and cutaways
happy april colored bonnets twelve
out their people st simon s
opened their doors like wide
until the people pouring
surely resembled happy laughter as
or else waved white bouquets
church of the epistles stood
twelve vestrymen carrying out the time
custom of giving away easter eggs full
face powder to the
going debutantes of the
around them delightedly danced
cute and curled shining like sparkling
jewels upon their mothers fingers
the rich laundered sweet smelling complexioned of
soft in door voices little arthur was
child of the middle
undistinguished unnoticed with a nose
forever marred what grecian yearnings his
tightly to his mother s warm sticky
other side moved upon the
coming throng at fifty third street where
was at its thickest its richest their
was of necessity retarded to such an
that even little arthur
not the slightest difficulty in keeping
then it was that merlin
an open landaulet of deepest crimson
up to the curb and
to a stop in it sat caroline
trimmed with lavender flowered at the waist
a corsage of orchids
since his marriage he was
the girl again but
girl no longer her figure
of the first blooming of her
was there now and
charming lines of a
nine and twenty and she sat in
and self possession that it made him
that very easter and its
not quite the radiance
back there in the
sad but it was soft enough and
hats off their wetted iridescent
to the edge of
landaulet where her lavender

his perhaps well favored companion
you ll just pardon
have to speak to
up within three minutes
inch of the landaulet front
sentence clever enough to
stream of conversation luckily for
a portion of little arthur
clothing had chosen the opportunity to
a collapse and olive had
rushed him over against a building
some extemporaneous repair work so
was able to watch unhindered
black bouquet sat caroline enthroned
her obliterated car nodding and
sudden a new relay
crowd now phalanx deep
not possibly have known caroline jostled
and melted into the circle of ever
centre of a vast impromptu
all about her were faces
spreading to the opposite
and as st anthony
street the motors speeding along
and in a jiffy were piled
the edge of the crowd
had become terrific no fashionable audience at
a world s series could be compared
the panoply that talked
lady in black and lavender
was stupendous it was terrible
the same corner a frightened civilian crashed
alarm and sent in a
paean for all the fire engines
the city up in an apartment
old maid telephoned in turn for
on bolshevism and the maternity ward
first fire engine arrived filling
sunday air with smoke
down the high resounding
in the notion that some
calamity had overtaken the city two
hilda s and st anthony s presently
by the jealous gongs of st

epistles even far off in the hudson
the east river the sounds of
commotion were heard and the
melancholy cadence now varied now reiterated across
from riverside drive to the gray
fronts of the lower east side in
centre of her landaulet
the lady in black and lavender
pleasantly first with one
with another of that
few in cutaways who had

with a look of
annoyance she yawned and asked the man
her if he couldn t run
somewhere and get her a
his own ear as
first blast of the river
rompers and looked up
of surprise and disapproval that
at merlin that mingled reproach
arthur with one hand grasped
in a winding bumping canter
the crowd somehow people
way before her somehow
managed to retain her grasp on
son and husband somehow she managed
away into a dim and distant clamor
little arthur upon his
and on sunday too
t she disgraced herself enough this
her only comment she said it to
as she seemed to address
remarks to arthur throughout the remainder of
she had never once looked at
husband during the entire retreat iv the
between thirty five and sixty five
round of ill gaited
colors then in dull grays and
but perplexing and intolerably dizzy
merry go rounds of
youth for most men and women these
years are taken up with a gradual
from life a retreat
from a front with many shelters those
amusements and curiosities of youth to a
with less when we peel
our ambitions to one ambition our
a few to whom we
point that is not
where the shells now
was no different from
a gray twinkling near his
a more certain lack of
in his walk his forty five differed
his forty by a like margin unless
mention a slight deafness in
left ear but at fifty
the process had become a chemical change
immense rapidity yearly he
more and more an
man to his family senile almost
he was by this time complete owner
the bookshop the mysterious
moonlight quill dead some five years
he still spent his days conversant
upon tooling and binding upon folios
first editions an accurate inventory of
thousand authors whom he
doddered he had assumed
melancholy habits of the aged so often
victorian comedies he consumed vast warehouses
and materially he was
entirely different from the
it seemed incongruous that he
the bookshop with the assistance of
considered very idle indeed
a new young woman miss gaffney
the accounts young arthur was gone
wall street to sell
as all the young
seemed to be doing in that
should be let old merlin get what
he could from his books the place
young king arthur was in the
house one afternoon at
when he had slipped noiselessly up
the front of the store on his
of which to be fair he
rather ashamed of spying
the young man clerk
reach the street a limousine large
impressive had drawn to the
and holding some sort of conversation
persons in the interior of the
turned about and advanced in a
fashion toward the entrance
the moonlight quill he opened
at the old man
the skull cap addressed him
a thick murky voice as
nodded the arithmetic books
in the back of
and scratched a close cropped
head oh naw this
thumb back toward the limousine
seen it in the
firs addition merlin s
quickened here was possibly a big
oh editions yes we ve
some firsts but detective stories
beautifully naw interrupted the
sinews were being commented on silver bones

bones silver bones indian maybe merlin stroked
purchaser if you wanna
think the old lady goes wile
everything don t run smooth but
s musings on the subject of silver
five minutes later a very
see the visible symbols of a
uproar going on in the interior of
limousine the chauffeur made wild appealing gestures
driver s seat his expression was
of the limousine opened
i can do for

grandmother her knowledge as
majority happens to be a matter of
that you advertised in last sunday

whistle whew come on you re not

our attic with my
play things that were written before the
boy that wrote this was
merlin stiffened expressing a rigid and
horror did your grandmother give

said merlin with dignity that she
missed a very great bargain give you
urged the young man
to hold us up
volume under his arm and was about
return it to its special
in his office when there was
sudden interruption with unheard
open and admitted in the
interior a regal apparition
black silk and fur
bore rapidly down upon him the cigarette
urban young man and
gave breath to an inadvertent
but it was upon merlin that the
and incongruous effect so
treasure of his shop slipped from
hand and joined the cigarette on
floor before him stood caroline she
an old woman an old woman remarkably
still an old woman
hair was a soft beautiful
the edges of her eyes and
deeper lines in the form
stanchions connected her nose
the corners of her mouth her
were dim ill natured and querulous
it was caroline without a doubt caroline
caroline s voice broken
shaky yet with a ring in it
chauffeurs want to drive laundry wagons
cause cigarettes to fall
the fingers of urban grandsons she
and sniffed her eyes found the
that she cried the words were
a question they were an entire litany
said to her grandson stand
and blow that nicotine
looked at her in trepidation blow
commanded he pursed his lips feebly and
into the air blow she repeated more
on briskly that you ve forfeited
thousand dollars in five minutes
fall pleading upon his
but such is the nobility
again into the air
from nervousness partly no
once more just once more and you
an even paler pallor than
natural to him but caroline was
i m senile you

my grandson very well
fur trimmed man made a
bow and hurried in some confusion
the shop as for you
turned to merlin and included
broken into a cracked but none
less spontaneous chuckle she seized his arm
hurried him to the other side of
store there they stopped
each other and gave vent to
long fit of senile
it s the only way she
malignity the only thing that keeps
folks like me happy is the sense
have poor descendants is almost
much fun as to be young
beautiful and have ugly sisters oh yes
merlin i know i envy you
i was in here forty years
she said you were
your heels i was he confessed
exclaimed i thought i used
think at first that you were
real person human i mean she
many men have thought me inhuman but
continued merlin excitedly i

perverse woman her old eyes

forgotten dream how i danced that
i remember you were making an attempt

word to her urban grandson
toward the door then she was gone

despair than were in the fate

and in a cross between
query and a cry exclaimed for god
sake harry how do you like

half an hour later as they
jeffrey and harry rose they re beautiful
said the husband intensely exquisite
harry roxanne beamed taste one
couldn t bear to touch them
you d seen them all and i
t bear to take them back until
find what they taste like
the biscuits to their lips nibbled tentatively
they tried to change the subject
roxanne undeceived set down the pan
comment rang out with
finality absolutely bum really why
didn t notice roxanne roared oh

parasite i m no goal jeffrey
his arm around her darling

the word they re decorative they re
we ll use them
returned with a hammer and
use them by golly roxanne we
make a frieze out of
the library repapered in october don t
for a moment like
live thing bang when roxanne returned with
second round of cocktails the biscuits
like a collection of primitive
into dusk and later it
a starry dark outside filled and permeated
being sensitive temperamental without
and never light and roxanne
up in her own
he thought again two very
until they suddenly find themselves old
thought these things between
constant thoughts about kitty he
depressed about kitty it seemed to him
she was well enough
come back to chicago
bring his little son he
thinking vaguely of kitty
friend at the foot of the
who was standing beside her
his hand on the end
with his fingers a little how did
said moodily splitting i
the stairs together ii harry s
passed they drove about
roxanne sitting inside played
them while the ashes whitened
the glowing ends of their cigars
came a telegram from kitty saying
she wanted harry to come
and get her so
and jeffrey were left alone in
privacy of which they never
to tire alone thrilled
again they wandered about
of the other they sat
the same side of the table like
they were intensely absorbed intensely happy the
of marlowe though a comparatively old settlement
only recently acquired a society
or six years before alarmed at the
three young married couples bungalow people had
and golf links yawned for
and there were bridge parties
they drank beer and parties where
after harry s departure there were
tables and a good
smoking and shouting their bets and
days roxanne had left the
early and taken to perambulation she
juice beer gave her
headache and then passed from table
table looking over shoulders
the hands keeping an eye on
content jeffrey with intense concentration
raising a pile of
of all colors and
liked to see him interested in small
she crossed over quietly and
down on the arm
his chair she sat
five minutes listening to the sharp intermittent
of the men and the chatter of
back his arm furiously caught
a glancing blow on her
there was a general
been the greatest shock
bewilderment settled on his face why
he said haltingly into
dozen minds entered a quick suspicion a
of scandal could it be that
love lurked some curious antipathy why else
streak of fire across such
voice was pleading startled and horrified she
mistake not once did it
to resent it her word was
trembling supplication tell me
it said tell roxanne your
the bewildered look changed to pain he
clearly as startled as she
as if some one were
the word was a prayer
darkness they were both on
feet they were saying good by faltering
explaining there was no attempt
their minds was the
horror of that blow the marvel that
had been for an instant something between
his anger and her fear and now
both a sorrow momentary no doubt but
while there was yet time was that
of some uncharted chasm
harvest moon he talked brokenly it
game absorbed and the touch on
shoulder had seemed like
attack an attack he clung to
impact of his hand it
gone that nervousness that was all
knew both their eyes
the broad night as
when they went to bed they were
calm jeffrey was to take
week off all work was simply to
had decided this safety settled down upon
the pillows underhead became soft and
the bed on which they lay
wide and white and
beneath the radiance that
days later in the
cool of late afternoon jeffrey picked up
through his own front window then
lay down on the couch like a
that sets in sometimes
one has missed a sleep or two
new sun that the quality of
life around has changed
is a fully articulate
that somehow the existence
is then leading is
picture or a mirror
the people and streets and
are only projections from a very dim
the first months of
s illness she slept only
she was utterly exhausted she
under a cloud the long
voiced consultations the faint aura of medicine
the halls the sudden tiptoeing in a
most of ail jeffrey s
face amid the pillows of
subdued her and made her indelibly older
doctors held out hope but that
all a long rest they
and quiet so responsibility came to roxanne
was she who paid the bills
his publishers she was in
kitchen constantly she learned from
nurse how to prepare
the nurse go for reasons of
one of the two
girls left at the same time roxanne
realizing that they had been living from
story to short story the
frequent visitor was harry cromwell he
been shocked and depressed by
news and though his wife was
living with him in chicago he
month roxanne found his sympathy
there was some quality of suffering in
comfortable when he was
roxanne s nature had suddenly
was losing her children also those children
after jeffrey s collapse and when the
had faded leaving not the
colder that she wait to see harry
wife finding herself in
with an extra hour
stepped inside the door she
was very like some place
cakes a stuffy pink pink
a food pink triumphant
it was pink it smelled pink mrs
attired in a wrapper of pink
heightened roxanne imagined by
so quickly to hospitality that
seemed they were both merely
the face and voice never touching nor
things were secondary her eyes were
it was vilely unclean from its lowest
up four inches it
sheerly dirty with the blue dust of
into its natural color
sleeves too and at the
to lead the way into the
roxanne was sure that her
was dirty a one sided rattle
likes and dislikes her head her
a sort of insolent meticulousness any
of roxanne with life as if presuming
the parlor a dirty little boy clad
dirty pink rompers his face
smudgy roxanne wanted to take
his nose other parts in the
shoes were kicked out at the toes
roxanne smiling radiantly come here to
held her head on one
and regarded it critically isn
he a darling repeated roxanne look at
needs a change don
connotated a garment extraneously smeared as this
i tried to make him
respectable this morning complained mrs cromwell as
tried and i found he didn t
any more rompers so rather than have
face how many pairs has he roxanne
asked oh mrs cromwell considered
her pretty brow five i
for fifty cents a pair
cromwell s eyes showed
and the faintest superiority
he ought to have plenty but i
t had a minute all
to send the laundry out then
the subject as irrelevant i must show
roxanne followed her past
of pinkness this was
cromwell s room here
hostess opened a closet door and displayed
roxanne s eyes an
collection of lingerie there
dozens of filmy marvels
lace and silk all
unruffled seemingly not yet touched
hangers beside them were
new evening dresses i have
beautiful things said mrs cromwell but
much of a chance to
them harry doesn t care about
perfectly content to let me play

roxanne interrupting but i ll have to
if i m going to catch
trembling she wanted to put them on
woman and shake her shake her
wanted her locked up somewhere
set to scrubbing floors beautiful
sorry harry isn t
they moved toward the door
yet her voice was still
and her lips were
s where you can get those rompers
it was the first five minutes in
at five o clock and coming
chair in a state
exhaustion roxanne herself had had a busy
and was worn out
doctors were coming at
thirty bringing a celebrated nerve specialist from
york she was excited
thoroughly depressed but harry s eyes
her sit down beside
what s the matter nothing roxanne
denied i came to see
bother about me harry
roxanne there s something
matter nothing he repeated how s
little worse harry doctor
definite he s going to try and
whether this paralysis has anything to do
the original blood clot harry rose oh

beer all at once he collapsed into
with his hands i
t make her happy he said slowly

i went to the office
left the house went east to her
lace underwear harry and i
t know there was
crunch on the gravel a
turning into the drive roxanne
a little cry it s doctor
wait won t you
interrupted abstractedly he saw that his
had already died on the troubled
of her mind there was
harry followed the party
and watched them disappear up
and sat down on
big sofa for an
the patterned folds of the
curtains in the deep quiet
proportions of a clamor
time to time another
drifted down from up stairs resembling
more larger wasps caught on larger
panes he heard low footfalls the
of bottles the clamor of
water what had he and
to them up stairs there
the soul of his
room listening to the plaint of a
boy he had been
by a strict aunt
sit hour long on a
and atone for some misbehavior
who had put him here what ferocious
had leaned out of the
to make him atone for what about
he felt a great
kick at her to tell her she
dirty moreover she must give
his boy he rose and began
up and down the room
he heard some one begin walking
time with him he
walk in time until the person reached
end of the hall kitty
gone to her mother god
her what a mother
s breast he could not that kitty
capable of any deep grief
her as something unapproachable and
she would get a divorce of
he began to consider this whom would
picture flashed before him of
s arms around some man whose face
could not see of kitty s
pressed close to other lips in what
aloud god god god then
the kitty of this morning
the soiled kimono rolled up and disappeared
pouts and rages and
all were washed away again she
great baby eyes ah she
loved him she had loved him after
while he perceived that something was amiss
was hungry simple enough he
go into the kitchen in a moment
ask the colored cook for
sandwich after that he must
wall jerked at something
and fingering it absently
a bright toy his teeth closed on
ah she d left that
it with her he thought it would
in the house like the
of their sick alliance he would try
able to bring himself to move
it would be like kitty soft and
kitty you couldn t
wall for another biscuit and with an
pulled it out nail and all he
removed the nail from the centre wondering
it was a huge nail he
he considered remembered yesterday he had had
dinner it was the
had said she felt smothery
couldn t bear having him
then lain down on the couch
to rest a minute before getting his
and awakened about eleven to find that
was nothing in the ice
s bureau this morning he had
lingerie in the closet was
been so hungry he thought at five
clock when the visiting nurse tiptoed down
staring at the carpet
cromwell yes oh mrs curtain
she s not well she
you say she s lying
just over did they did
softly doctor jewett says there
no hope mr curtain
live indefinitely but he ll
see again or move again
for the first time the nurse
that beside the writing desk
she remembered that she had seen a
of a dozen curious round
little nail holes harry followed her
dazedly and then rose to his feet
i believe there s a
she nodded harry picked up his
good by he answered
though talking to himself and evidently
by some involuntary necessity he paused on
way to the door
she saw him pluck the last
screen door and descending the
steps passed out of her
v after a while the
of clean white paint on the
paint leaned over backward like aged
practising grotesque gymnastics and finally dropped
the front pillars became streaky
the left hand door
the green blinds darkened then lost all
that was avoided by the
lot diagonally opposite for a graveyard and
combined with the place
enough to throw a ghostly
over that quarter of the
not that she was left alone men
women came to see her met her
town where she went to do her
came in for a moment to
still played in her
but men who did not know
no longer followed her
admiring glances in the street
destroying its vividness yet bringing neither wrinkles
fat she acquired a character in
were told of her
when the country was frozen over one
to skate so that she
a small bed beside his bed holding
as though he were
dead as the years dropped
those who had known
died or moved away there
but half a dozen of the
crowd who had drunk cocktails
called each other s
by their first names and thought that
was about the wittiest and most talented
that marlowe had ever known how
the reason that mrs
excused herself sometimes and hurried upstairs he
a groan or a sharp
borne to the silent
on the heavy air of a
afternoon he could not
except for a shift to his
the room his paralysis was
slowly toward his heart at first
the first year roxanne had
the faintest answering pressure sometimes when
held his hand then it
gone ceased one evening and never come
eyed staring into the dark
comprehension those shattered broken
been for her unceasing care the
and bathed him shifted him
her own hands from bed to
medicine straightening a pillow talking
him almost as one
appreciation but with the dim
of habit a prayer
faith has gone not a few
if jeffrey had been
he would have wished to die
if his spirit were hovering
such sacrifice from her it would fret
shaking her head gently when
effect you can t love that
can love what it once
do the specialist shrugged
say that mrs curtain was a
terrible pity there must be some
or a dozen just crazy to take
of her casually there were here and
some one began in hope
ended in reverence there was
for life for the
ill afford to the butcher who
her a cheap cut
steak across the meaty board
other phase was sealed
his face turned ever toward
the last wave to wash over his
middle of a may night when
the window sill and a breeze
cicadas outside roxanne awoke at two
the house at last
after that she sat
her weather beaten porch through
in a slow descent to the
and green town she was wondering what
would do with her life she
thirty six handsome strong and free the
acres to right and
of her and had even placed
small mortgage on the house with
husband s death had
having to care for
meetings in the butcher s
grocer s she missed the cooking
energy she went out
spaded up the whole garden a thing
she was alone at night in
room that had seen the glory of
marriage and then the pain to
jeff again she went
in spirit to that wonderful year
awoke often to lie and wish for
presence beside her inanimate yet breathing still
one afternoon six months
on the porch in
faintest suggestion of plumpness from
brown all about her a hush
by the sighing of leaves westward
four o clock sun dripping streaks of
a pillar kept up an intermittent cheeping
by occasional fluttering sallies overhead
could watch him and
mind idled drowsily on the
of the afternoon harry
was coming out from chicago to dinner
visitor they had kept up what amounted
a tradition between them when he
they would go to look at jeff
would sit down on the
of the bed and
a hearty voice ask well jeff old
how do you feel
day roxanne standing beside would look intently
its sole gesture toward the light
if something behind the blind
out these visits stretched over eight
on the porch he was devoted
of hiding no attempt to deepen
mass of flesh on the bed there
been his best friend
the past of his
the company for which he worked had
him to the east and only
business trip had brought
to the vicinity of chicago roxanne had
helped her move two
together how s george

the only thing to do to send

interested harry must bring him
had only seen him once
her life a child in dirty
she left him with the newspaper while
together they continued their talk
george if i had a child

given her what slender advice he could
garden pausing here and there to recognize
the tennis court had lain
you remember then they were
the sketch harry had made
jeff and roxanne lying
in the grass their heads
touching there was to have been a
house so that jeff could get
on wet days the lattice had
broken triangular piece that still
to the house and resembled a battered
coop and those mint juleps
remember how we d
a page of material and how
he used to get
his writing they were both silent a
and then harry said we were
to buy the adjoining twenty acres and
of her harry why yes he

striking left and right
his tobacco pouch and
around him the rest of his
then they mounted their steers and
a ticktock on the tantrum window
a pin in the doorbell and
a retreat a week
the tantrums had put
liver oil in the doldrums
and so from year
year the feud had continued first
the other the birth of
every day little jemina worked the
on her side of
stream and boscoe doldrum worked the still
inherited hatred the feudists would throw
at each other and jemina
h�te but now jemina
too thoughtful to look across the
how wonderful the stranger had been and
oddly he was dressed in her innocent
she had never believed
there were any civilized
belief in them down to the credulity
the mountain people she
in whiskey from his still
the other side of the
hi thar boscoe doldrum
returned she continued her way to
cabin the stranger was talking
on the tantrum land and
stranger edgar edison was trying to
the land for a song
offer she sat upon her hands
watched him he was wonderful when he
came a blood curdling scream
tantrums rushed to the windows
was the doldrums they had hitched their
to trees and concealed themselves
soon a perfect rattle of stones and
her father took down his slingshot
his slingshot rack on
wall and ran his hand lovingly
the elastic band he stepped to a
old mappy tantrum stepped
the coalhole a mountain battle
stranger was aroused at last
to get at the doldrums he tried
crawling up the chimney then
thought there might be
told him there was not
and sofas but each
him there were no doors
but kept up their fusillade of
aperture they would pour in
the fight would be over
the mouth and expectorating
the ground left and right
tantrum had not been without
effect a master shot had disabled
doldrum and another doldrum shot almost incessantly
fly shouted the stranger
bear you away no
bar jemina away i will bar
tantrum who stood at the
throwing loophole after loophole at the advancing
that he too had tantrums
bear away but that he would
retreat if he could
of a way of doing
soon smoke began to filter
had come up and touched a match
the whiskey in the bathtub caught fire
looked at each other jemina he
stranger she answered we will die
he said if we had
and married you with your
to hold liquor your social success would
left leg was on fire
was a human alcohol lamp their lips
in one long kiss and then
them out as one
the doldrums burst through
ring of flame they found them
jem doldrum was moved
took off his hat he
it off they air
after each other the
them so they threw them together into

supple with a spoiled alluring mouth
than clad in blue satin slippers which
nonchalantly from her toes were
adjoining the one she occupied and
she read she intermittently regaled herself
a faint application to her
of a half lemon
on the deck at her feet
rocked very gently to
fro at the almost imperceptible motion of
tide the second half lemon was well
pulpless and the golden collar
yacht was broken by the sound of
footsteps and an elderly man topped with
white flannel suit appeared at the
of the companionway there he
for a moment until his
became accustomed to the
under the awning he
doomed to disappointment the girl calmly turned
and then very faintly but
unmistakably yawned ardita said the
haired man sternly ardita uttered a
sound indicating nothing ardita
three words to slip out before
reached her tongue oh shut up ardita
will you listen to me or
i have to get
servant to hold you while
have the decency to close that abominable
two minutes oh can t you lemme

just received a telephone message from the
telephone she showed for the first time

in your infatuation for this man a
a man your father would not

from ardita with the agony of a
soul will you stop boring

instinctive step backward and
two cautious steps forward ardita jumped

and walking forward called in a loud
lemon i am going ashore he
slowly i will be out

looked at her and then all at
him helpless uncertain utterly

expecting agreement but receiving no
or sound of it

the half lemon caught him
farnam too full of words
one utterly condemning glance at
niece and turning ran swiftly down
ladder ii five o clock
a glittering island and
faint breeze that had been
swaying one of the dangling blue
a chorus of men
close harmony and in perfect rhythm to
accompanying sound of oars
the blue writers ardita lifted her
and listened carrots and peas
on their knees pigs in the seas
fellows blow us a breeze blow
a breeze blow us
in astonishment sitting very
she listened eagerly as the
greens and costellos blow
a breeze blow us a
blow us a breeze with your
her book to the
straddle and hurried to the rail fifty
seven men six of them
and one standing up in the stern
and rocks sawdust and socks who
eyes suddenly rested on ardita
was leaning over the rail spellbound
curiosity he made a quick movement
his baton and the singing
ceased she saw that he
the only white man in the
narcissus ahoy he called politely what
ardita cheerfully is this the varsity crew
this time the boat was scraping
side of the yacht and a great
grasped the ladder thereupon the leader
before ardita had realized his
stood breathless before her on the
the women and children
be spared he said briskly all crying
put in double irons digging her
excitedly down into the pockets of
dress ardita stared at
speechless with astonishment he
a young man with a
mouth and the bright blue eyes of
was trimly built trimly dressed
graceful as an agile
son of a gun she said
they eyed each other coolly
you surrender the ship is
are you an idiot or
being initiated to some fraternity i
thought the country was dry said
disdainfully have you been drinking finger
enamel you better get off this yacht
incredulity get off the
her for a moment as
scornful mouth slowly no i won
get off if you wish going to
rail be gave a curt command
line before him a coal
and burly darky at one end and
miniature mulatto of four
of blue costume ornamented with dust mud
tatters over the shoulder of each
containing musical instruments ten
here babe the smallest
take command go down below catch the
and tie em up
to gather about him then
a short whispered consultation they all filed
cheerfully to ardita who had
this last scene in withering silence
keep that spoiled little
of yours tight shut
otherwise you re going to sea in
ship with a little sigh as
a crisis well passed the
man sank into the
arms lazily the corners of his mouth
appreciatively as he looked round at the
striped awning the polished brass and
luxurious fittings of the deck
eye felt on the
he said stonewall jackson claimed that lemon
cleared his head your head feel
clear ardita disdained to answer because
of five minutes you
it s go or stay he
up the book and opened it curiously
revolt of the angels sounds pretty
french eh he stared
french no what s
name farnam farnam what ardita farnam well
down ardita took a carved jade
from her pocket extracted a cigarette
trembling a little then
other settee blew a mouthful
smoke at the awning you can
get me off this yacht she raid
far with it my uncle
have wirelesses zigzagging all over this ocean
quickly at his face caught anxiety stamped
plainly in the faintest depression of the
s corners it s
don t mind going for a coupla
you that book so you
have something to read on the revenue
that takes you up to sing
s advice you needn t bother this
part of a plan arranged before i
knew this yacht existed if it
anchored along the coast who are you
all seven of us
curtis carlyle and his six
buddies late of the
we were until to
bags you see there we re
from justice and if the reward offered
our capture hasn t by
time reached twenty thousand dollars i miss
guess what s in the bags
ardita curiously well he said for
present we ll call it mud florida
very frightened engineer the yacht narcissus was
have carlyle s implicit confidence
s valet and the chef the only
except the engineer having
fight were now reconsidering
securely to their bunks below trombone
the biggest negro was set
the name hula hula
the others congregated aft and
to be prepared and
on deck at seven thirty carlyle rejoined
and sinking back into his settee
closed his eyes and fell into
a romantic figure he gave
on a slight foundation
under the surface of
of his decisions she discerned a
that was in decided contrast
the arrogant curl of
lips he s not like
being a supreme egotist ardita frequently thought
did it entirely naturally and with no
nineteen she gave the effect
youth and beauty all the men and
she had known were
driftwood on the ripples of her
she had met other
in fact she found that selfish
her feet but though she recognized
egotist in the settee
felt none of that
shutting of doors in her
contrary her instinct told her that this
was somehow completely pregnable and quite
be herself and she felt that this
on the contrary was preoccupied
she was in her own situation
affected her as the prospect
her ability to take care of herself
misty eyed upon the sea
as the shore faded dimly out and
far horizon a great
yacht and spread an avenue of glittering
a match as one of them lighted
cigarette but except for the low under
as a dream boat star bound through
broke the silence at last lucky girl
sighed i ve always
seem to possess a lot
nerve for a flapper i wish you
t call me that
your pardon as to nerve she continued
it s my one
hm i am to be afraid said
be very great and strong or
a moment and eagerness crept into
done and how did you
a movie about me go on
do a fabulous story a negro appeared
on a string of small
wicker table for supper and while they
jam from the plentiful larder below carlyle
eagerly as he saw she
interested ardita scarcely touched her
as she watched his
young face handsome ironic faintly
he began life as a poor kid
that his people were the only
never remembered any white children but there
amount of trouble he
always getting them in
into a strange channel there
white children that would have passed curtis
with a sniff but the
little poh white used to sit beside
piano by the hour
one of those kazoos that boys hum
craze hit the country and
took six darkies on the orpheum
had grown up with
divine who was a wharf
round new york and long before that
stuck an eight inch stiletto in
master s back almost before carlyle
his good fortune he was on
with offers of engagements on
ever dreamed of it was about then
a change began in his
attitude a rather curious embittering change
was when he realized that he
spending the golden years
his life gibbering round a
his act was good of its
rhythm that made all the difference but
began to grow strangely sensitive
it began to hate the
of appearing dreaded it from day to
called for more but
told them that he wanted
they laughed at him aud told him
was crazy it would he an
afterward at the phrase artistic suicide they
used it half a dozen times they
at private dances at three
for his mode of livlihood they took
in clubs and houses
in the daytime after
the eternal monkey a
the very smell of
of the greenroom and the
approval of the boxes he
t put his heart into
any more the idea of a slow
to the luxury of liesure drove him
all he wanted to have a
to read and play and the sort
men and women round
that he could never have the
who if they thought of him
contemptible in short he wanted all those
the general head of aristocracy an aristocracy
making it he was
five then without family or education
a business career he began speculating
and within three weeks
had lost every cent
had saved then the war
he went to plattsburg
even there his profession followed
he could serve his
better as a band leader so he
that when the infantry came limping back
the trenches he wanted to be one
wore seemed only one of those
did it after i came back
we had an offer from a syndicate
florida hotels it was only
off and ardita looked at him expectantly
tell you about it i m enjoying
d lose a little of that enjoyment
i shared it with anyone else
breathless heroic moments when i stood
before them all and
them know i was more than a
bobbing squawking clown >from up
came suddenly the low sound
singing the negroes had gathered together on
deck and their voices
together in a haunting melody
soared in poignant harmonics toward
moon and ardita listens in
oh down oh down
wanna take me down milky way
mammy say to day carlyle sighed
at the gathered host of stars blinking
sky the negroes song had
away to a plaintive humming and
brightness and the great silence were increasing
midnight toilet of the
as they combed their silver dripping curls
the moon and gossiped to each
of the fine wrecks
below you see said
softly this is the beauty i want
has got to be astonishing astounding it
got to burst in on you like
dream like the exquisite eyes
you anita i mean
in the dense sun flooded
of next day a spot in
sea before them resolved casually into
green and gray islet apparently composed of
great granite cliff at
northern end which slanted south through a
of vivid coppice and grass to a
beach melting lazily into
and slamming the book shut looked
rail is this it
this where you re going carlyle shrugged
sort of sporting doesn t it
she agreed but it doesn t look
enough to be much of a
in those wirelesses your uncle
going to have zigzagging round no
ardita frankly i m all for
i d really like
with us as a mascot for
present anyway you couldn t
well ask me to swim back
said coolly if you do i
going to start writing
novels founded on that interminable
of your life you gave me last
m very sorry i bored you
you didn t until just at the
with some story about
dance with the ladies
played music for he rose angrily
have got a darn mean little
but i m not
with the story of their
ambitions especially if they
lived such deathly platonic lives why
do men usually regale
with oh they talk
oh i agree quietly does every man
meet tell you he loves you
nodded why shouldn t he
down that s very true that
that s not bad
you make that up yes
rather i found it out it
clever it s the sort of remark
said gravely that s typical of your
start that lecture on aristocracy
i distrust people who can
intense at this hour
breakfast food jag morning s the time
sleep swim and be careless ten minutes
they had swung round in a wide
mean just to anchor up
this cliff they were heading straight in
toward the solid rock which must have
within fifty yards of it did ardita
their objective then she clapped
hands in delight there
a break in the cliff entirely
through this break the yacht entered
very slowly traversed a
channel of crystal clear water between high
at anchor in a miniature world of
as glass and set
with tiny palms the whole
bad cried carlyle excitedly i guess
round this corner of the atlantic
became quite jubilant it s an absolutely
s the sort of island you read
the rowboat was lowered into the golden
and they pulled to shore come on
we ll go exploring the fringe
palms was in turn
in by a round mile
flat sandy country they followed
of tropical vegetation came out
seemed to have permanently
sauntered back to the yacht
he had posted a lookout
the high cliff to the
to watch the sea on both
had never even seen
map on which the
was marked what s
name tall chuckled babe reckin she jus
at s all in the
afternoon they sat with their
against great boulders on the highest part
his vague plans he was sure they
total proceeds of the
dollars he counted on lying up
several weeks and then
the usual channels of travel rounding
horn and heading for callao
provisioning he was leaving
sailed these seas in every
coffee trader to virtual first mate
a brazillian pirate craft
skipper had long since been
if he d been
guile of every race and nationality
that s half a dozen
i m a liar
worships me because i
me with an oboe and we
blend minor keys in african harmonics
thousand years old until
rats would crawl up the posts
sit round groaning and squeaking like
phonograph ardita roared how
can tell em carlyle grinned i
going to do when you get
into afghanistan somewhere buy
a palace and a reputation and
with a foreign accent
the world drifts very gradually back to
something fascinating about that to me and
want leisure to read an
amount how about after
then he answered defiantly comes
laugh if you want to but at
you ll have to admit that i
what i want which i imagine is
you i was in the midst
a great uproar of
my friends and relatives because i did
what i wanted what
you hadn t come aboard i had
intention of slipping ashore yesterday evening how
ago it seems and meeting
in palm beach he s waiting there
me with a bracelet that once belonged
your family disapproved eh
there is of it only a
red haired woman name mimi something
was frightfully exaggerated he said and men
t lie to me
anyway i didn t care
he d done it was the
when a man s in
amusements i told him
drop her like a hot cake
he did i feel rather jealous
carlyle frowning and then he laughed
guess i ll just
you along with us until we
to callao then i ll lend you
money to get back to
states by that time
ll have had a chance to think
gentleman over a little more
t talk to me like that
up ardita i won t tolerate the
abashed as her cold
seemed to fold him about and
offered uncertainly oh don t
a pause ensued a
which carlyle found rather awkward but
ardita seemed not to notice at all
and gazing out at the
face over the edge looking down carlyle
look she cried there s
there wide ones of all
t you rather go
at the beach on the other end
a chance i like to dive
like a gunny sack because
s a very flabby man i ve
coast from biddeford pool
st augustine i suppose you
a shark yes i m pretty good
sculptor up at rye
summer told me my calves are
five hundred dollars there didn t
to be any answer to this
carlyle was silent permitting himself only
discreet interior smile v
the night crept down
it to a jutting rock
climbing the cliff together
first shelf was ten
up wide and furnishing a
in the bright moonlight and watched the
as the tide set
are you happy he asked suddenly she
always happy near the sea
i are somewhat alike we
both rebels only for different reasons two
ago when i was just eighteen and
were twenty five well we were both
in the army gentleman by
of congress he put in ironically
at any rate we both fitted if
they were at least
in but deep in
both was something that
didn t know what
wanted i went from man to
restless impatient month by month getting
acquiescent and more dissatisfied i
to sit sometimes chewing at the
crazy i had a frightful
now here i was beautiful
am aren t i yes agreed carlyle
ardita rose suddenly wait a
to the end of the ledge
doubling up in mid
and then straightening out and
to water straight as
in a minute her voice
up to him you see
resent society come on up here he
what on earth are you doing just
i enjoyed was shocking people wearing
fancy dress party going round
the fastest men in
as she began climbing up side to
ledge go on in she called obediently
dripping and made the climb he found
she was no longer on the ledge
after a frightened he heard her light
from another shelf ten feet
there he joined her and they both
the climb the family were
she said suddenly they
to marry me off and then when
d begun to feel that after
life was scarcely worth living i
words came with a
courage just that courage as a
of life and something to
to always i began to build up
began to see that
past some manifestation of courage had
been the thing that
the beaten bloody prize fighter
up for more i used to make
take me to prize fights the
woman sailing through a nest
they were mud under her feet
liking what you like
the utter disregard for other
s opinions just to
bring up the cigarettes he handed
kept gathering old men and
men my mental and
inferiors most of them but all intensely
to have me to own this
see sort of you never
beaten and you never
never she sprang to the edge poised
a moment like a crucified figure
the sky then describing a dark parabola
without a slash between two silver
twenty feet below her voice
up to him again and courage
me meant ploughing through
on the value of life and the
of transient things she was
symmetrically back appeared on
level all very well
carlyle you can call it courage
your courage is really built after
on a pride of
moon he was farther back
niche in the rock
don t want to sound
pollyanna she began but
haven t grasped me
my courage is faith faith in
eternal resilience of me that
ll come back and
lips shut and my chin high and
i ve been through
without a whine quite often
that before joy and hope and all
came back the curtain was drawn on
for good ardita rose and going
the wall climbed with
difficulty to the next ledge
see her better not dive
there you ll break your back
in her young perfection that lit a
glow in carlyle s heart we
our feet straight out behind like a
s tail and we re going to
down there till suddenly it
be all warm round us and full
little kissing caressing waves
not realized that the
eternity before he heard the
of relief when her
of the cliff and into
three days of afternoons when the sun
crowd chuckling and chattering
the rail as she
an agile minnow on and under
would swim and loll and smoke with
upon the cliff or else they would
infinite langour of a
evening and with the
sprig of romance in a desert
reality gradually left her
dreaded the time when he
eventualities that presented themselves to
thoughts were suddenly troublesome and decisions
had prayers found place in the
would have asked of life only
be unmolested for a
lazily acquiescent to the ready naif
of carlyle s ideas his
boyish imagination and the vein of monomania
his temperament and colored
of two on an island
concerned primarily with love bred
two personalities and its
stream is quite incidental most of
are content to exist and breed
fight for the right to do both
the dominant idea the
attest to control one s
is reserved for the fortunate or unfortunate
to me the interesting
tarnish with her beauty
in the grass under the
spreading palms the negroes had brought
sound of weird ragtime
drifting softly over on the warm
of the night i
indian lady she continued
looked at her quickly
can you know she
bride society girl kidnapped by ragtime
your illusions my dear
you i mean your illusions about yourself
looked up in surprise about
with whatever stray felonies you ve committed
remains to be seen
hand dear mr curtis carlyle she
softly are you in love
me as if it mattered but
does because i think i
in love with you
looked at her ironically thus
your january total to half a
me shall i he shrugged his
of life can you
me i don t mean that unkindly
seriously what would become of
thousand dollar reward ever catch
away just to show one man
m not i wish you d
poor just a little
cow country wouldn t it have been
i d have enjoyed astonishing you watching
you only wanted things don t you
the big oblong watch
decide it was too expensive
choose one of white gold for a
and we d go into the
it can t you see us
round and spending money right and left
waiters oh blessed are the
love you ardita he said gently
became oddly grave i love
be with you she
ever met and i like your looks
your dark old hair and the
you go over the side
the rail when we come ashore in
curtis carlyle i like all the things
do when you re
natural i think you ve got nerve
been tempted to kiss
just an idealistic boy
just a little bit
and a little more bored
d go with you as it is
think i ll go back and marry
other man over across the silver lake
figures of the negroes writhed and
through their tacks from sheer
over their instruments like piping fauns
from trombone and saxaphone
let s dance cried ardita i
stretch of hard sandy
that the moon flooded with great
they floated out like drifting moths under
rich hazy light and
exulted and wavered and
ardita s last sense of
dropped away and she
her imagination to the dreamy summer scents
tropical flowers and the infinite
spaces overhead feeling that if
to find herself dancing with a ghost
of unnumbered generations of cannibals are watching
side of the cliff there
it was immodest of me
come without my nose ring they both
softly and then their laughter
as over across the lake they
a bar and the
out what s the
called carlyle after a moment s silence
made out the dark
of a man rounding
closer they saw it
babe in a state of unusual
he drew up before them
gasped out his news in
breath ship stan in off sho bout
uz on watch he say look
if she s done ancho d a
ardita s heart gave a sudden
as she saw his
face suddenly droop he
he don t know
are they landing a boat no
we ll go up said carlyle
ascended the hill in
finished dancing she felt it clinch
from time to time as though
seemed an hour s
cautiously across the silhouetted plateau to the
of the cliff after one short
carlyle involuntarily gave a little cry it
a revenue boat with six inch guns
fore and aft they know he
with a short intake of breath
know they picked up the trail somewhere
channel they may be
standing by to take a look at
island in the morning
where they are they couldn t
the opening in the cliff they could
field glasses he said
he looked at his wrist watch
won t do anything until dawn that
certain of course there s
right here the hour passed and they
their chins in their hands
squatted the negroes patient resigned acquiescent announcing
just before five o clock babe
carlyle there were half a dozen
aboard the narcissus he said had it
decided to offer no resistance a pretty
fight might be made
thought if they worked out some plan
laughed and shook his head
revenue boat it d
like a bow and arrow trying
fight a machine gun if you
to bury those bags somewhere and
a chance on recovering them
go on and do it but it
t work they d dig
to the other it s a lost
all round babe babe inclined his
silently and turned away
he turned to ardita there s the
d die for me and be proud
if i d let him you
of course there s always one
can wait i wouldn t miss my
for anything it ll
was at all times
of a gentleman don t she
blue changed to leaden gray a commotion
visible on the ship s
and they made out a
of officers clad in white duck
near the rail they had field
in their hands and were attentively examining
grimly damn whispered ardita she felt tears
in her eyes we ll go back
a possum leaving the plateau they
the hill and reaching the
were rowed out to
and weary they sank into
settees and waited half an hour
and six bluejackets and
other four rowers and in
in yachting flannels ardita and
other then he paused and
his hand suddenly into his
and held it out to
what is it she asked wonderingly i
not positive but i think
of those bags you see curtis carlyle
room of the hotel at palm
suddenly changed their instruments for automatics
held up the crowd i
got nerve he bowed
the shadows reeling into gray
mist thin as a
infinitely transient and already fading for a
sea and sky were
young mouth of life then
out in the lake came
complaint of a rowboat
the swish of oars suddenly
the golden furnace low in the east
spoiled young mouth it
a sort of glory he murmured after
benediction an ecstatic surety
as much as she
ever know for another instant life was
and time a phantom
their strength eternal then there was
bumping scraping sound as the rowboat
alongside up the ladder
his arms and stood
at his niece so
said nodding his head
with a sigh her
away fell upon the boarding
her uncle saw her
he knew so well so he
a high seas pirate ardita
the best you can say for yourself
s that well known phrase with which
have ended most of our conversations for
and with that she turned included the
old men the officer and
two sailors in a curt glance of
but had she waited an
longer she would have
quite unfamiliar in most of
latter turned briskly to carlyle who
cryptic amusement well toby
said genially you incurable hare brained romantic
was the person you
carlyle smiled confidently why naturally he said
ve been perfectly sure ever
babe send up the rocket last night
m glad you did said colonel moreland
close to you in case you should
trouble with those six strange niggers
we hoped we d find you two
some such compromising position he
up all night hoping for the
you re welcome to her my boy
s run me crazy did
carlyle nodded sh he said she
coming on deck ardita appeared at
head of the companionway and gave a
involuntary glance at carlyle
begun to sing and the cool
voices ardita said carlyle unsteadily she swayed
step toward him ardita
repeated breathlessly i ve got to
name isn t carlyle
air she stared at him
amazement disbelief and anger flowing in quick
across her face the
men held their breaths
senior took a step toward her mr
s mouth dropped a little
crash but it did
come ardita s face became suddenly
and with a little
she went swiftly to
a trace of wrath in her
eyes will you swear she said
an imagination she said softly and almost
i want you to
that she had heard them
before time is a
leaf as it yellows what was
the bags she asked softly florida mud
answered that was one of the
true things i told you perhaps i
guess the other one
in the illustration the
palace the sunlight dripped over
house like golden paint over
art jar and the
shadows here and there only intensified
rigor of the bath of
the butterworth and larkin houses
were entrenched behind great stodgy trees only
happer house took the full sun
all day long faced
this was the city
tarleton in southernmost georgia september afternoon
in her bedroom window sally
happer rested her nineteen year
year old sill and watched
darrow s ancient ford turn the corner
car was hot being partly metallic
absorbed or evolved and clark
considered himself a spare part
rather likely to break he laboriously
two dust ruts the
with a terrifying expression he gave
steering gear a final
and deposited self and car
steps there was a heaving
this quite impossible unless she raised her
perfunctorily at attention as he
for an answer to his signal after
moment the whistle once
split the dusty air good
with difficulty clark twisted
tall body round and bent a distorted
on the window tain t
sally carrol isn t
sure enough what you
eatin n apple come on go
want to reckon so how bout hurryin
sure enough sally carrol sighed voluminously and
herself with profound inertia
the floor where she
parts of a green apple and painting
dolls for her younger sister she
a mirror regarded her expression with
two spots of rouge on her
and a grain of powder on her
hair with a rose littered sunbonnet
she kicked over the painting water
oh damn but let
as she slipped nimbly
mighty fine sally carrol where
rather inclined to stoop his
were ominous and his expression somewhat petulant
when startlingly illuminated by one
income just enough to keep himself in
invest his capital for
immediate fortune hanging round he
not at all difficult
crowd of little girls had grown up
the amazing sally carrol foremost among them
the flower filled summery evenings and
about to do something
meanwhile were quite willing to
or a game of billiards
the consumption of a
in a while one
these contemporaries made a farewell
of calls before going up to
and noisy nigger street
and especially of gracious
voiced girls who were brought up
memories instead of money the ford having
excited into a sort of restless resentful
clark and sally carrol rolled and rattled
valley avenue into jefferson street where the
into the down town section driving
perilous here for it was shopping
streets and a drove of
moaning oxen were being urged along
retiring into a state of utter and
coma sally carrol said clark suddenly
engaged she looked at him quickly where
you hear that sure enough
engaged at s a nice question
told me you were engaged to a
town for rumors don
clark she demanded suddenly who on earth
couldn t support a wife she
at doesn t mean

reached over and pressed his hand

lazy days and nights you

i d get restless i d
i was wastin myself
s two sides to me you

part of me that
be useful somewhere that ll last when
of with characteristic suddenness
mood changed half closing
back she let the savory breeze
her eyes and ripple the
curls of her bobbed
they were in the country now
hang a cool welcome over
passed a battered negro cabin
beside the door and half a
scantily clothed pickaninnies parading tattered dolls on
out were lazy cotton fields
shadows lent by the
to the earth not for
but to while away some
sally carrol we re here poor chile
soun asleep honey you dead
last outa sheer laziness
you her eyes opened sleepily hi she
broad and brisk came
from his northern city to
hanging fire since he and sally carrol
met in asheville north carolina in
the settlement took only a quiet afternoon
a glowing open fire for harry
had everything she wanted and beside she
her she kept especially
and she found their steps
haunts the cemetery when it came in
the cheerful late sun she paused
by the iron gate
then let s go in here it
some folks but i
it they passed through
gateway and followed a
that led through a wavy
of graves dusty gray
ornate and hideous for
nineties with fat marble cherubs
impossible growths of nameless granite flowers
tributary flowers but over
of the graves lay silence and
leaves with only the fragrance
their own shadowy memories could waken
hill where they were fronted
dark spots of damp and half
over with vines margery lee she read
dear margery lee she
softly can t you see
harry yes sally carrol he felt a
hand insert itself into his she
hair with a ribbon in it
gorgeous hoop skirts of alice blue and
rose yes oh she
a wide pillared porch and
folks in i think perhaps a lot
men went away to war
maybe none of em ever did
here to show of
better than just margery lee and that
date she drew close to him and
as her yellow hair
his cheek you see how
was don t you harry i see
agreed gently i see through your
eyes you re beautiful now so
know she must have been silent
close they stood and he could
stirred the brim of her floppidy hat
was pointing to a flat
rows like the stacked arms
a battalion those are the
they walked along and read the
always only a name and a date
quite indecipherable the last
cross has just a date on
and the word unknown she looked at
to me darling if you don
no it s not me it
them that old time that i ve
wouldn t have been unknown but they
still husky her eyes glistening with tears
onto things and i ve
grown up with that dream it was
weren t any disillusions comin to
i ve tried in a way to
up to those past standards
noblesse oblige there s
you know like the roses of an
garden dying all round us streaks of
a confederate soldier who lived next
you understand but it was there i
he assured her again
sally carol smiled and
her eyes on the tip of a
protruding from his breast pocket you
i cry i m happy here and
and walked slowly away finding
grass she drew him down to a
of a low broken wall
those three old women
kiss you sally carrol me too
waited impatiently for the three
to fade out and all her
and tears to vanish in an
back together while on the corners twilight
month at least it ll
slick there s a winter carnival on
seen snow it ll
like fairy land to you there
be skating and skiing and tobogganing and
riding and all sorts of
t had one for years so
re gong to make it
your nose but you
t be shivery cold
s hard and dry you know
ve ever seen she broke off and
were both silent for a
sally carol he said very
what do you say to march i
i love you march march harry iii
night in the pullman it
the bedclothes to snatch a few
sleep she wanted to look her best
uncomfortably into her clothes
up to the diner for a cup
the vestibules and covered the door
cold it crept in everywhere her
was quite visible and she blew
the air with a naive
window at white hills and valleys and
and lone on the
waste and with each
she had an instant of
the diner and swayed back
the pullman she experienced a
the north the north her land now
blow ye winds heighho
roving i will go
chanted exultantly to herself what
the telegraph poles doubled
tracks ran up beside the
a dazed moment in the frosty
upon her there she is
kissed her and then she was
a group of faces all
smoke she was shaking hands
were gordon a short eager man of
who looked like an amateur knocked about
a listless lady with flaxen hair under
fur automobile cap almost immediately sally carrol
of her as vaguely scandinavian a
chauffeur adopted her bag
perfunctory listless my dears
from the station then they were
crooked succession of snowy
where dozens of little
were hitching sleds behind
do that can we harry
s for kids but we might it
like such a circus she said
home was a rambling frame house
and there she met
her these were harry
parents there was a
indescribable hour crammed full
self sentences hot water bacon
asking him if she
chairs had little lace squares
the couch was just comfortable
books looked as if
had been read some and
father s huge medical books
uncles and the old couch that
and was still luxurious to dream in
room struck her as being
attractive nor particularly otherwise it was simply
things in it that
looked about fifteen years old
do you think of it up
out her arms to him but after
enthusiasm from her the town
the pep in the air oh harry
laughed you ll have to give me
you can t just fling questions at
a sigh of contentment one thing i
emphasis on family and all that not
it isn t quite all right but
that ll seem to
sally carrol but just remember that
is a three generation town
has a father and about half of
have grandfathers back of that we don
our grandfathers you see founded the
to take some pretty
social model for the town well
father was the first public ash
carol puzzled did you s pose i
people not at all interrupted harry and
m not apologizing for any one
it s just that
i d tell you sally carrol felt
indignant as though she had been unjustly
closed for he went on with
great surge of enthusiasm it
carnival time you know
in ten years and there
an ice palace they re building new
the clearest ice they could find on
the window pushed aside the heavy turkish
and looked out oh she cried
makin a snow man harry do
don t guess this
a very kissable climate
it i mean it
you so you don
want to sit round doesn t
we re not going
i ve got a
for the first week
dance to night oh harry she confessed
in a heap half
sure do feel confused i
it or not an i
softly if you ll just tell me
re glad to be
glad just awful glad she whispered
herself into his arms in her own
for me harry and as she said
she was acting a part that
amid the gleaming candles of a dinner
the talking while the
aloofness even harry s presence on
left failed to make her feel
t you think he
tackle at princeton last year
fellow next to him were both yale
captains junie was in
states round here this
fishburn who s he asked
carrol innocently don t you know i
they forget to introduce
my name s roger patton
coming you a relative no i m
re from the south aren t you
tarleton georgia she liked
immediately a reddish brown mustache under watery
him again after coffee she was
to numerous good looking
men who danced with conscious
and seemed to take it for granted
she wanted to talk about nothing
harry heavens she thought they talk
if my being engaged made me
than they are as
i d tell their mothers
them in the south an engaged
even a young married woman expected
and flattery that would be accorded
debutante but here all that seemed banned
subject of sally carrol
eyes and how they had allured him
since she entered the room went
a violent convulsion when he found she
visiting the bellamys was harry s fiancee
made some risque and inexcusable blunder
immediately formal and left her
the first opportunity she was rather
when roger patton cut in on her
cheerily how s carmen from the
dan mcgrew sorry but he
the only northerner i
much about he seemed to enjoy
of course he confessed as
professor of literature i
not supposed to have
dangerous dan mcgrew are you a native
i m a philadelphian imported from harvard
ten years nine years three
an sixty four days longer
me like it here uh huh sure
saw you look out the
m used to havin everythin
out an see a flurry of
an it s just as if
indicating the swirling floor sally carrol
i m sorry that
worse than i meant it
see i always think
people as feline or canine
feline so are you so are most
men an most of these girls here
s harry harry s
ve to night seem
be canine what does canine imply a
conscious masculinity as opposed to subtlety
so i never analyzed
only i just look at people an
canine or feline right
theory about these people i think they
re growing like swedes
you know very gradually getting gloomy
read ibsen she shook her head well
find in his characters a certain brooding
sorrow or joy without
or tears exactly that s my theory
swedes up here they come i imagine
their own and there s been a
mingling there re probably not half
four swedish governors am
sister in law is
swedish personally i like
but my theory is that swedes react
badly on us as a whole
suicide rate in the world why do
live here if it
me i m pretty well cloistered and
suppose books mean more
people to me anyway but
know spanish senoritas black
tears sally carrol thought of
graveyard she supposed that that was vaguely
she had meant when she said it
t depress her the italians
about the gayest people in the world
anyway i want to tell
you re marrying a pretty fine man
carrol was moved by an
of confidence i know i m the
of after a certain point and
feel sure i will
shall we dance you know he
find a girl who knows what she
of it as a sort of
into a moving picture
she laughed and liked him immensely two
later on the way home she nestled
harry in the back seat oh
she whispered it s so co old
it s warm in here daring
but outside it s cold and
that howling wind she buried her face
in his fur coat and
involuntarily as his cold lips kissed
the first week of her visit passed
a whirl she had her promised
a morning tobogganing on the country
hill even tried skiing to sail through
air for a glorious moment
a soft snow drift she liked all
winter sports except an
pale yellow sunshine but
soon realized that these things
for children that she was
humored and that the enjoyment round
them to mr bellamy
with his iron gray hair and
once she found that
was born in kentucky this made of
a link between the old
the women she felt a
hostility myra her future sister
spiritless conversationality her conversation
her if those women aren
beautiful she thought they re
look at them they re glorified domestics
detested the first day s impression
an egg had been confirmed
such an ungracious dumpiness of carriage that
carrol felt that if
once fell she would surely scramble in
mrs bellamy seemed to typify
and could not be persuaded that the
name was presenting her to the public
clothed she loved sally carrol
stairs after that first day
mrs bellamy had come
the library sniffing violently
all the men she met
preferred roger patton who was a
to the ibsenesque tendency
the populace but when he
curled upon the sofa bent
forget what he d said that
was all rot they had
resist a gasp of
appreciation look harry what that
face yes why it
that already everybody s healthy
we re out in
cold as soon as we re old
to walk wonderful climate she looked
he was mighty healthy looking so was
brother and she had noticed the new
in her own cheeks
and held and they stared for
moment at the street corner
his eyes gazing upward
to make a leap
coming closer they discovered
had been a ludicrous
illusion produced by the extreme bagginess of
man s trousers reckon that
mischievously why harry her
southerners sally carrol s eyes flashed don
call em that i m
dear said harry malignantly apologetic
you know what i think of them
not they may be lazy
would be in that
criticised in any such sweepin
of all the hangdog ill
a bunch of small town
are the worst sally carrol
furiously why continued harry if there
we all thought that at
we d found the true type of
aristocrat but it turned out that he
t an aristocrat at all
about all the cotton round
quite different i told
i wouldn t want to tie my
silence i probably spread it on a
sorry she nodded but
no answer five minutes later as they
in the hallway she
she cried her eyes brimming with
let s get married next
i m afraid of having
like that i m afraid
it wouldn t be that
the wrong was still irritated that
tears in sally carrol s eyes faded
expression hardened slightly very well
s forget that very night
the end of a vaudeville
the orchestra played dixie and sally
day brim up inside her she
get you dear whispered harry but
did not hear him to the limited
beat of the kettle drums
on into the darkness
as fifes whistled and
in the low encore they seemed
away away away down south in
away away away down south in
sudden thaw had nearly
the streets the day before but
they were traversed again
a powdery wraith of loose snow that
in wavy lines before
feet of the wind
no sky only a dark
tent that draped in the tops
a vast approaching army
snowflakes while over it all chilling
the comfort from the brown and green
trot of the horse pulling
sleigh interminably washed the north wind it
a dismal town after all she
dismal sometimes at night it
of sleet oh if there should be
on her grave to be beneath
would be a light shadow against
shadows her grave a grave that should
flower strewn and washed with
and rain she thought again of those
country houses that her train
passed and of the
soft drifts of snow finally
slow cheerless melting and the
her spring to lose it forever with
with a gradual insistence the storm
sally carrol felt a film
eyelashes and harry reached
a furry arm and drew
the horse bent his neck patiently as
transparency of white appeared momentarily
his coat oh he s cold
he likes it after another ten
they turned a corner and
hill outlined in vivid glaring green
the wintry sky stood the
the air with battlements and embrasures and
icicled windows and the innumerable
lights inside made a
sally carrol clutched harry s hand
cried excitedly my golly it
t had one here
eighty five somehow the notion
there not having been one
eighty five oppressed her
of it was surely peopled
those shades of the
him out of the sleigh
mighty jingle of bells there were quite
crowd already bundled in fur
sheepskin shouting and calling to each
as they moved through
that people could scarcely be distinguished a
and seventy feet tall harry was saying
as they trudged toward the
of conversation one main hall
herself repeating over and
it was a miracle of rare
a sunny pleasure dome with
shut out she took
seat on a wooded bench and
the smooth surface of the walls the
oh boy cried harry a
in a far corner struck up
hail the gang s all here which
suddenly went out silence seemed to
down the icy sides
could still see her white
of pale faces over
the other side the music eased to
remnant chant of the marching
it grew louder like
paean of a viking tribe traversing an
wild it swelled they were
nearer then a row
another and keeping time with their
feet a long column of
their shoulders torches soaring and
as their voice rose along
a long platoon of blue and white
met round at dances the volume
of fire of colors
the rhythm of soft leather steps
leading column turned and
until the whole procession made
solid flag of flame
then from thousands of voices burst a
shout that filled the air
a crash of thunder and sent the
wavering it was magnificent it was tremendous
sally carol it was the north offering
on some mighty altar
the gray pagan god
up again and there came
listening while the staccato cries rent the
and then she started for there was
volley of explosion and great
the flash light photographers at work and
once more took up their chant and
to march out come
at the bottom of
chute was a long
room of ice with the ceiling so
down one of the half
glittering passages that opened into the room
was only a vague
blot against the green shimmer harry
called come on he cried
she looked round the empty chamber
evidently decided to go home were already
somewhere in the blundering snow she hesitated
then darted in after harry harry
left and with a touch of
answer she started to run
come enveloped in a
the outlet into the
low room but it was
another glittering passage with darkness at
end she called again but the
gave back a flat lifeless
another corner this time following a
between the parted water of the
sea like a damp vault
formed on the bottom of her overshoes
slippery half sticky walls to keep her
bounced mockingly down to the end of
passage then on an
frightened cry and sank down into
her left knee do
lost settled upon her
rose from ice bound whalers in
arctic seas from smokeless trackless wastes where
it was an icy breath of
it was rolling down low
the land to clutch
her with a furious despairing
she rose again and
get out she might
lost in here for
freeze to death and lie embedded in
the melting of a glacier harry probably
had gone by now no
would know until next day she
pitifully for the wall forty inches
both sides of her along
damp souls that haunted this
this town this north oh
somebody send somebody she cried aloud clark
ewing she couldn t
left here to wander forever to
this her this sally carrol
she was a happy thing
was a happy little girl she liked
and summer and dixie these things
foreign foreign you re not crying
said aloud you ll
cry any more your
would just freeze all
full length on the ice oh
she faltered a long
file of minutes went by and
down near her and take
face in warm soft
it s margery lee she
as sally carrol had known she would
with a young white brow and
welcoming eyes and a hoop skirt of
rest on margery lee
sure enough only that would spoil em
course still you ought to be
to see em then after a succession
resolving themselves into a
cracking noise break her
found stillness it was the sun it
a light a torch and
and voices a face
flesh below the torch heavy arms
her and she felt
on her cheek it felt
her face with snow
ridiculous with snow sally
mcgrew and two other faces
didn t know child child
ve been looking for you two
harry s half crazy things
rushing back into place
marching clubs she squirmed in
home her voice rose
a scream that sent a chill to
down the next passage to morrow
morrow to morrow vi the wealth of
great to do in a cool spot
among the branches of a tree next
and down the street
colored woman was announcing herself melodiously
a purveyor of strawberries
chin on her arm and
arm on an old window seat
sleepily down over the spangled dust whence
heat waves were rising for the
time this spring she was
a jolting stop at the end
the walk see made no sound
from under the car top below tain
in affected surprise i guess maybe
what you doin eatin
green peach spect to die
minute clark twisted himself
last impossible notch to
a view of her face water
sally carol wanta go swimmin
to move sighed sally
lazily but i reckon so
and received the grade
excellent in caesar cicero
leading the sophomore class by
lengths and digging out theses
and during the battle of
to wait until his
birthday before beginning his series
essays on the pragmatic bias
the new realists after a while
newsboy told him that the war was
that peat brothers publishers would get out
new edition of spinoza s

he could never forgive the
for allowing a brass band

generally that she didn
moon who promised her
thousand pall malls if she would pay
charlie was a senior
sheffield and he and horace were
cousins they liked and pitied each other
had been particularly busy
night the failure of
frenchman laurier to appreciate the
of the new realists was preying on
mind in fact his only
to a low clear cut rap at
study was to make
speculate as to whether any rap
have actual existence without an
there to hear it he fancied he
at that moment though he did
know it he was verging with
the rap sounded come in muttered
and then close but bent over
book in the big armchair before
fire he did not look up
it on the bed in the other
on the bed in the
room marcia meadow had to
like byplay on a harp
hm he replied testily suppose
go back and get it
the fire from horace
way of exercise and variety
chair he called berkeley the
he called hume he suddenly heard
sound as of a
diaphanous form sinking into
he glanced up well said
with the sweet smile she
omar khayyam here i am beside you
in the wilderness horace stared
her dazedly the momentary
existed there only as a
women brought laundry and took your seat
the street car and married you later
when you were old

art emanation from hume
leather arm there if
looked long enough he would see
be would be alone again in
room he passed his fist across his
so critical objected the emanation pleasantly
feel as if you were going

there wouldn t be
left of me except my shadow
you forgot he had a body

alibi my name is not omar i

that you yourself were alive
1881 marcia stared at him
wonder me 1881 why

sol smith s juliette why omar
was a canteen singer during the
of 1812 horace s mind
a sudden successful leap
he grinned did charlie moon put
up to this marcia regarded him inscrutably
s charlie moon small wide nostrils big
marcia bit her lip
then yawned oh let s change the
omar i ll pull a snore
this chair in a minute yes replied
s your friend and will
die then of a sudden horace tarbox
slenderly and began to pace the
this was his other gesture i
t care for this he
quite a pretty little thing but i
t like charlie moon s

about his week in paris any right

of lolling in bed until seven
marcia nodded understandingly do you ever

sternly i like you

horace shook his head later perhaps he
you see i m a plan i
an experiment i don t say that

then changing his mind
his walk after an unsuccessful attempt to
at her marcia smiled
him please explain horace

the wheels go round my father
of answering every question i asked

near her opened curiously at the
of a feminine voice a tentative
marcia dived wildly down the
in the murky connecticut air
up stairs horace paced the
of his study from
found that his circuit of the floor
bringing him each time
the diaphanous form still seemed
near and had horace sat there
would have felt as
and though horace couldn t have
the quality of difference
was such a quality quite intangible
radiating something that in all
hume was radiating attar of roses ii
thursday night horace tarbox sat in an
seat in the fifth row and
that he was enjoying himself
cynical students near him were
jokes in the hammerstein tradition but
her song about a
warm glow settled over him
he did not join
the storm of applause he felt
numb in the intermission after
second act an usher
beside him demanded to know if he
mr tarbox and then
him a note written
a round adolescent band

an odd thing do you

without another word marcia signalled for the
briskly my part the
the waiter figured it see here

she took her first glance at
a bit forward and his gray
to him they were
together in a world where the
rouged row of ballet faces
were as imperceivable as powder on a
venus an instinctive defiance rose within
hundred a week perpetual motion she grumbled
marcia guy i don
of stage fright she had
him had hurried from the theatre immediately
night in her apartment thinking as
had so often in the
face his slim boyish fore the merciless
and now that he had
though an unwonted responsibility was being
demanded the negro comedian standing
that the way she did
wasn t suggestive any more
suggestive she made it a stunt
downtown jelly on a
after sundown shiver by the
he was not watching
now she saw that clearly
was looking very deliberately at a
that s the vibration
thrills me funny how affection fi
she was suddenly and horribly
of her audience as
had never been since her
appearance was that a leer on
pallid face in the
row a droop of disgust on one
girl s mouth these shoulders of hers
shoulders shaking were they
were they real surely shoulders weren
a glance i ll need some
ushers with st vitus dance at the
of the world i ll
bassoon and two cellos crashed into
final chord she paused
poised a moment on her toes
every muscle tense her young face
out dully at the audience
stage into the dressing room
sped kicked out of one dress
into another and caught a taxi
her apartment was very warm small
and sets of kipling and
henry which she had bought
from a blue eyed
and read occasionally and there
several chairs which matched
were none of them
with blackbirds painted on it
an atmosphere of other stifled pink
there were nice things
it nice things unrelentingly hostile to
taste acting in stray moments the worst
seen from the erie railroad
a frantic oddly extravagant
marcia knew it was a failure
and took her two hands awkwardly i
you this time he said oh i
said her arms went out to
she kissed his mouth
you he said she kissed him again
then with a little sigh flung herself
infant prodigy she cried very well call
that if you want
thousand years older than you i am
be disapproved of no one s ever
she asked why do you
and put his hands in his pockets
i love you marcia meadow
then she stopped calling him omar dear
she said you know i
of love you there s
about you i can
tell what that just puts my heart
round you but honey she paused
what but lots of
but you re only just eighteen
i m nearly twenty nonsense
interrupted put it this
that makes us pretty
your people my people exclaimed
prodigy ferociously my people tried to
grew quite crimson at
to say my people can go way
and sit down my heavens cried marcia
tacks yes he agreed wildly
anything the more i think of
they allowed me to become a
re that asked marcia quietly me yes
person i ve met
the streets since i met you has
me jealous because they knew what love
before i did i used to
it the sex impulse heavens there s
buts said marcia what are they how
we live i ll make a living
anything about taking a master of
degree you want to be master of
hey yes what i
no marcia laughed and crossing swiftly
sat in his lap
put his arm round her wildly and
her neck there s something
about you mused marcia but it
t sound very logical oh
t be so darned
marcia i hate these
as marcia couldn t talk through her
she had to iv horace
marcia were married early
february the sensation in academic circles
at yale and princeton
tremendous horace tarbox who
fourteen had been played up in
sunday magazines sections of metropolitan
was throwing over his career his
of being a world authority on
but like all modern stories
was a four and a half day
two weeks search during which his
of the value of academic knowledge faded
a south american export company some
had told him that exporting was the
thing marcia was to stay in
five to start with and
would be earning double that marcia refused
was getting at the
we ll call ourselves
and shoulders dear she said
and the shoulders ll have
keep shaking a little
until the old head
she replied emphatically your salary

be public i don t i want
be yours but i d be
half wit to sit in
room and count the sunflowers on the
paper while i waited
you when you pull down
hundred a month i ll
and much as it hurt his pride
course march mellowed into
may read a gorgeous riot
to the parks and waters
manhatten and they were very happy horace
had no habits whatsoever
had never had time to form any
the most adaptable of husbands
as marcia entirely lacked opinions on the
different spheres marcia acted as
factotum and horace lived either in
a sort of triumphantly earthy
energy and her unfailing good humor
marcia s co workers in the nine
her tremendous pride in
husband s mental powers
looking young man who waited
night to take her
horace said marcia one
when she met him as usual
there against the street
you losing weight he shook
head vaguely i don t
they raised me to a
and thirty five dollars to day
i don t care
marcia severely you re killing yourself working
long after i m

a baking summer he spent three
experimenting on the trapeze in skipper s
and in august he
to marcia that it made him
of more mental work during
don t believe in
replied marcia i tried one
bunk you stick to gymnastics
night in early september while he
contortions on the rings in
nearly deserted room he
addressed by a meditative
man whom he had noticed watching him
several nights say lad do that stunt

him from his perch i invented it
said i got the idea
well he must of broke
neck doin that stunt i set
last night thinkin sure
horace and swinging onto the trapeze

here s another chirped
eagerly and the fat man s mouth
pink jerseyed prometheus again

following this encounter horace got home from
to find a rather pale marcia stretched
on the sofa waiting for
i fainted twice to day she
baby s due in

money well said marcia wearily i
t know where it s coming
coat where are you going i ve
an idea he answered i
be right back ten minutes later
s gymnasium he felt a placid
quite unmixed with humor at what he
gaped but when you opened
in many things the gymnasium was brightly
and when his eyes became accustomed to
mats smoking a big
well i ve been
it over and i
i d like to
it i could work at
and on saturday afternoons and
if the pay is high
watch well he said
see he ll book you inside of
days once he sees you work out

of him for to morrow night the
charlie paulson arrived next night and
the prodigy swap through the air
he brought two age
low passionate voices then on the
made its first professional appearance
coleman street gardens but though
himself marcia he said cheerfully later
same night i think we
out of the woods

that means an all winter
the hippodrome you know is
big yes i believe

marcia but i want to
doing it isn t
spectacular suicide is it

up and wound both
and call me dear heart i love

no more sam pepys
something trick and trashy i
do all day i
like writing letters but
didn t have anybody to

horace i ll read them i
grew very tired indeed and
a row of nights it
place was taken by a young
who wore pale blue instead of white
got very little applause but after the
days horace appeared again
those who sat close to the stage
an expression of beatific happiness
middle of his amazing and original
elevator man and dashed
a time and then tiptoed
smiled up at him
horace there s something i
you ll find a big stack of
it s a book sort
horace i wrote it
you d take it to that
in his paper he could tell
whether it d be
the way i talk
the way i wrote
letter to him it s just
story about a lot of things that
he leaned over the bed until his
was beside her on the pillow
to call me dear heart he whispered
call her they rested a minute in
drowsy content while horace considered
said at length why the
who first introduced us that so
was moon her eyes dosed and
a moment the slow
that she was asleep horace tiptoed
to the bureau and opening the top
by marcia tarbox he smiled so
hour passed and he became
that marcia had waked
came in a whisper
marcia do you like it horace coughed
seem to be reading on it
bright take it to peter boyce
tell him you got the
marks in princeton once and that you
to know when a book s good
world beater all right marcia horace said
pity then he left
room all that night the
the weird punctuation danced before
each time full of a welling chaotic
soul to express itself in words
pathetic about it and for
to turn over in
a series of books
had popularized pessimism and william
pragmatism but life hadn t come that
rap at his door the diaphanous shadow
man who sat in berkeley
temerity to wonder if
rap would have had actual existence had
ear not been there to hear it

souls trying to express ourselves

he finally produced a clipping from a
you too horace s eye skipped down
a passage lower down he
suddenly aghast read on hurriedly marcia tarbox
connection with the stage is not only
a spectator but as the wife
horace tarbox who every evening delights
his wondrous flying performance it is said
the young couple have
themselves head and shoulders referring
to the fact that
tarbox supplies the literary and mental
family fortunes mrs tarbox
only twenty horace stopped reading and
eyes gazed intently at anton
what about raps don t
a padded door the cut
a smooth stone age
a bronze age and many
in the cut glass age when
ladies had persuaded young
with long curly mustaches
marry them they sat
several months afterward and wrote thank
notes for all sorts of cut glass
punch bowls finger bowls dinner glasses wine
and vases for though
it was then especially busy
the dazzling light of
from the back bay to the fastnesses
the middle west after
sideboard with the big
in the centre the glasses were
up in the china closet the candlesticks
the struggle for existence began
bonbon dish lost its little handle
became a pin tray
a promenading cat knocked the little bowl
the sideboard and the hired girl chipped
the wine glasses succumbed to
fractures and even the dinner glasses
one by one like the
scarred and maimed as
genteels on the bathroom
this had happened the
day the curious mrs roger fairboalt
my dear said the curious
roger fairboalt i love your house
think it s quite artistic i m
eyes and you must come
had been dropping in on
for the past six months mrs fairboalt
at that ripe age
love the dining room
she said all that marvellous
piper laughed so prettily that mrs
story quite vanished oh that
was a vivid rose petal
you remember young carleton
was going to marry harold seven
ago in ninety two he drew himself
s as hard as
are and as beautiful
see through he frightened me a
he was going to
me a haunted house
something that would explode when
and a half feet or perhaps it
three and a half anyway the
dear wasn t that odd and
left town about then didn t
mrs fairboalt was scribbling italicized notes on
south or somewhere answered mrs
time mrs fairboalt drew on her
approving the effect of largeness given by
beyond it was really the nicest smaller
in town and mrs piper
talked of moving to a larger
money as she turned into the
under the gathering autumn
she assumed that disapproving
unpleasant expression that almost all
women of forty wear on
street if i were harold piper she
i d spend a little
time on business and a little
should speak to him but if
fairboalt had considered it a successful
had she waited two minutes longer for
she was still a
receding figure a hundred yards down the
herself and with a rather
expression led him quickly into the
did harold frighten you into this she
her head i m
fred she said slowly and her lips
never looked to him
home last night sick with
jessie piper s sense
and told him he was hurt
we ve been club gossip all
and he didn t know it and
he understands snatches of
he s caught and veiled hints people
angry fred and he loves me
my trouble s like yours i can
plainly his gray eyes
s over my god
i ve been sitting down
the office all day looking at
and looking at it you ve
slight emphasis of hurry in her voice
a new thrust for him i
t see you i know
being here with you this
is one of the things
can t do they were still
and as she spoke she made
little movement toward the
gedney looked at her miserably trying here
a last picture of her and
suddenly both of them were stiffened into
at the sound of steps on the
outside instantly her arm reached out
the lapel of his coat half
half swung him through the
door into the dark dining
i ll make him go
stairs she whispered close to his ear
the stairs then go out the front
then he was alone listening as
greeted her husband in the hall
handsome with marginal notes
being eyes that were
close together and a certain
when his face was
matter was typical of all his
he had told evylyn that he considered
subject closed and would
reproach her nor allude to it
of looking at it that she
not a little impressed yet
he greeted evylyn with
and dress harold she
eagerly we re going
me long to dress
and his words trailing
evylyn s heart clattered loudly harold
in her voice and followed
you ll have to hurry
why he asked a trifle impatiently
stretched out in a
chair and unfolded a newspaper with a
was standing breathless in the
the decanter on the
then it occurred to
the decanter and a glass she
she couldn t risk the other chance
at the same moment harold rose
throwing his paper down came toward
evie dear he said bending
putting his arms about her i hope
re not thinking about last night she
close to him trembling i know he
your part we all make
evylyn hardly heard him she was wondering
up the stairs she thought of
sick asking to be
up unfortunately she knew he
lay her on the couch and bring
whiskey suddenly her nervous
moved up a last impossible
she had heard a very
the dining room fred was trying
get out the back way then
hollow ringing note like a
s arm had struck the big cut
away and the room seemed
crash about her ears
the rattle of a tin
into the kitchen and pulled
the gas her husband s arm slowly
from gedney s neck and he
there very still first
amazement then with pain dawning in
then repeated my golly he
as if to jump again
gedney stopped his muscles visibly
people you people evylyn s arms
around him and her eyes were
pushed her away and
dazed into a kitchen chair his face
porcelain you ve been doing things to
evylyn why you little devil
little devil she had never felt
sorry for him she had
wasn t her fault said
shook his head and
expression when he stared up
as if some physical accident
jarred his mind into a
inability to function his eyes
suddenly pitiful struck a
unsounded chord in evylyn
simultaneously a furious anger surged in her
felt her eyelids burning she stamped
foot violently her hands scurried nervously
the table as if searching
a weapon and then she flung
wildly at gedney get out she screamed
eves blazing little fists beating helplessly
this get out of here
men had followed had vanished her
were still as large and
dark and as sad
the mystery had departed
sadness was no longer eternal only human
she had developed a
when she was startled or
of twitching her brows together
been vaguely mocking and beautiful was
gone when she smiled now the
days when she revelled in her own
evylyn had enjoyed that smile
hers she had accentuated it
she stopped accentuating it
faded out and the last of her
the freddy gedney affair externally things had
an very much as
had before but in those few
during which she had discovered
much she loved her
she struggled against aching silences wild reproaches
accusations she pled with
made quiet pitiful little love to
and he laughed at
bitterly and then she
slipped gradually into silence and a
surge of love that
risen in her she
wonderingly as a part
her life the next year a piling
of mutual interests and responsibilities and
and wife together again
left she might have
of silence had slowly dried
the springs of affection
her own desire to drink again of
time to seek women friends to
books she had read
to sew a little where she
watch her two children to whom
she saw crumbs on the dinner
her mind drifted off the conversation she
receding gradually into middle age
exceptionally busy one for
were entertaining on short notice
night as she stood in her bedroom
in the late afternoon she discovered that
was quite tired ten
before she would have lain down
slept but now she had a feeling
things needed watching maids
cleaning down stairs bric a brac
all over the floor and
that had to be talked
write donald who was fourteen and
his first year away at school she
nearly decided to lie down nevertheless when
julie down stairs she
and she blinked julie she called ah
the voice of hilda the second
floated up the stairs she cut herself
little mis piper evylyn
found a torn handkerchief
hurried downstairs in a moment julie
searched for the cut faint disparaging evidences
which appeared on julie s
h h t urts it was the
i polished the sideboard and julie come
an went to foolin with
heavily at hilda and twisting julie
handkerchief now let s see it dear
held it up and evelyn pounced there
in her tear stained face
sniffled and waggled it again you
cried evylyn and kissed her but
way nowadays if she could get a
irishwoman but you couldn t any more
these swedes at five
up to her room threatened
her thirty five times for her birthday
said shortly and then added qualitatively a
you something now i guess you ve
things haven t beep going quite right
her hair but at these words she
and looked at him how do
in town her voice expressed
alarm there was said
significantly but this clarence ahearn is a
man i was surprised when you
he was coming to dinner evie he
on with another slap at
knee after january first the
ahearn company becomes the ahearn piper company
the sound of his name in second
was somehow hostile to
don t understand harold well evie ahearn
been fooling around with marx
those two had combined we
along picking up smaller orders hanging back
and ahearn and marx would have had
business just like ahearn and piper
going to now he
and coughed and a little cloud of
floated up to her nostrils tell
the truth evie i ve suspected
with it ambitious little lady i
t help her much here is she
asked evie never met her
name s been up at the
club five months no
taken he waved his hand disparagingly ahearn
i had lunch together to
him and his wife up to
just have nine mostly
big thing for me and of course
ll have to see
evie thoughtfully i suppose we will evylyn
not disturbed over the social end
it but the idea of
brothers becoming the ahearn piper company
her it seemed like going
his voice from down stairs
evie come down she went
into the hall and called over
want you to help me make
her dress she descended the stairs
found him grouping the
on the dining room
she went to the sideboard
lifting one of the bowls carried it
oh no he protested let
five and tom and
that s seven and your
and joe ambler that s nine you

only about three quarts and there s
of us and the servants ll want
s so much more cheerful to have

say the small one again he shook
head obstinately no be
drunken men in the house
now evie he grasped the smaller bowl
lift it back instantly her hands
on it holding it down
was a momentary struggle and then
a little exasperated grunt
from her fingers and carried it
the sideboard she looked at him
only laughed acknowledging her defeat
she left the room
gown greeted her volubly evelyn disliked
approved of he had keen blue
and a natural gift of pleasing
not so obviously committed the blunder of
too early in his career i
said simply it looks
though your husband and i are
to see a lot of
milton piper harold s quiet unassertive younger
tom irene her own unmarried sister and
joe ambler a confirmed bachelor and
way into dinner we
m wife s greatest achievement mrs
she ll give you the recipe
a slight he caught his
for this batch here s
evylyn noticing that ahearn
milton piper and all the
were shaking their heads negatively
the maid knew she bad
right about the bowl
was still half full she resolved
caution harold directly afterward but when
women left the table mrs ahearn
her and she found herself talking
and dressmakers with a polite show
interest we ve moved around a
chattered mrs ahearn her red
ve never stayed so long
don t you well you see i
always lived here so naturally oh that
to have a wife he
up i got so
her little laugh again evylyn
that it was her society laugh your
is a very able
clarence is ideas and enthusiasm you
finds out what he wants and
goes and gets it evylyn nodded
room mrs ahearn s history
unfolding jerkily but evylyn
ceased to listen the
odor of massed cigars
to drift in it wasn t
a large house she reflected
an evening like this the library
perhaps this partnership might she
to speculate on a
house mrs ahearn s
would like the recipe if
have it written down
men strolled in evylyn saw
once that her worst fears were realized
s face was flushed
his words ran together
the ends of sentences while
onto the couch beside her
sat there blinking dazedly at the
him but she saw no
his cigar only ahearn and milton piper
unaffected it s a pretty fine town
said ahearn pleasantly you find it more
wondered uncomfortably if it bored
one as it bored
apparently not they were
listening attentively evylyn broke in at
first gap where ve you
she remembered that mrs ahearn
t matter harold mustn t talk
much he was such an ass when
in tell you ahearn firs

people snobbish town first toward outsider but
long after know you
like you he indicated ahearn and his
get by first barrer bar barrer he
and then said barrier repeated
masterfully evylyn looked appealingly
her brother in law but
crowding out of tom
hindered by the dead cigar which he
firmly with his teeth huma uma ho
resignedly and with difficulty tom removed the
it landed liquidly and limply
pardon he mumbled and rose
ungracefully flounced the tobacco from her skirt
the floor never once looking at it
was sayin continued tom thickly fore at
ahearn i was sayin i
all truth that country
lemme lone he said
sat there in a panic trying
make her mouth form words she saw
face turning a vivid red
watch chain fingering it i heard who

awkwardly to his feet in a
were listening with eager intentness then mrs
swallowed and turned with a
smile toward jessie evylyn saw tom
forward and put his hand on ahearns
swole up and her cheeks
hot and she s moanin
groanin julie is evylyn asked sharply the
suddenly receded she turned quickly sought
her eyes for mrs ahearn slipped
her if you ll excuse me
ll be down when i can she
and ran quickly up the stairs
cigar smoke and a loud discussion in
centre of the room that seemed to
the light in the nursery she
odd little cries she put her hand
the cheeks they were burning with an
until she found the
was swollen to the wrist
in the centre was a little inflamed
blood poisoning her mind cried
terror the bandage had come off
cut and she d gotten something
o clock it was
she rushed to the phone
racked her brains and in desperation
her throat specialist and bit her
furiously while he looked up the numbers
she thought she heard
voices down stairs but she seemed to
minutes she located a physician who sounded
and sulky at being
hand found it was somewhat more
hair over and over with
rose and stared toward the door
the lace of her dress caught
the bed rail and
fumbling fingers she found the
in front tore the whole pannier completely
and rushed from the
out in the hall she heard
single loud insistent voice but as
stairs it ceased and an outer door
the music room came into
only harold and milton
there the former leaning
was a little trouble then harold saw
and straightening up with
effort began to speak sult m
cousin m own house god damn common
rish sult m own cousin tom had
milton my lord milton cried evylyn couldn
you have done something i
s poisoned herself get him
bed if you can
no attention evylyn brushed by through the
room catching sight with a burst
horror of the big punch bowl still
the table the liquid from melted ice
its bottom she heard steps on the
stairs it was milton helping harold up
let him go into the nursery she
the hours blurred into
nightmare the doctor arrived
before midnight and within
half hour had lanced the wound he
at two after giving
the addresses of two
to call up and promising
return at half past
it was blood poisoning at four
hilda by the bedside she
to her room and
with a shudder out of
to the nursery while hilda went to
coffee not until noon
she bring herself to look
she did it was to
him awake and staring very miserably at
ceiling he turned blood shot hollow eyes
her for a minute she
him couldn t speak a husky voice
from the bed what time is it
i made a damn fool
doesn t matter she said sharply
s got blood poisoning they
she choked over the words they think
ll have to lose her hand what
last night oh what does it
up in bed i
anger subsided and a great wave of
too yes she answered listlessly i
thirties it came to
a tentative outlay of wrinkles
collected rapidly on her legs
hips and arms her mannerism
habitual when she was reading or speaking
even while she slept she
families whose fortunes have gone
rather than up she and harold had
they looked at each other with
broken old chairs evylyn worried a
when he was sick
did her best to be
a disappointed man family
was over for the evening
she sighed with relief she
this evening and she didn t
irene shouldn t have made
no letter for three weeks now and
she hadn t known how
clubs were out harold had
on the porch for a breath of
air there was a bright glamour of
diffusing on the sidewalks and lawns
with a little half yawn half laugh
remembered one long moonlight
there was the problem
julie julie was thirteen and lately
was growing more and
sensitive about her deformity and preferred
stay always in her room
a few years before she had
frightened at the idea
going to school and evylyn could
bring herself to send
so she grew up in
the artificial hand that she made no
pocket lately she had been taking
in using it because evylyn
feared she would cease to lift the
she made a move with it in
hand would creep back to the
of her dress for a while her
moped around the house so
at a loss all one
that evylyn weakened and never tried
donald had been different from the
she had attempted vainly to keep
near her as she
tried to teach julie to lean
of donald had been snatched out
her hands his division had
abroad for three months she
again life was a thing for
what a happy youth she must
had she remembered her
her mother when she
aloud and severely to the moon
stepping inside was about to
the door when she heard
servant they kept only one now
martha she said in surprise
you was up stairs i
jist is anything the matter martha
a letter mrs piper
own letter asked evylyn no it was
and then the back door
rang i had it in my hand
an advertisement maybe or
business letter it was a
narrow one i remember they
a search through the music
looking on trays and mantelpieces
then through the library feeling
the tops of rows of books martha
where i went straight to
started hopefully for the dining
a gasp behind her evylyn had sat
heavily in a morris
together eyes blanking furiously are you
evylyn sat there very
and martha could see the very quick
are you sick she repeated no said
slowly but i know where the
is go way martha i
wonderingly martha withdrew and still
sat there only the muscles
her eyes moving contracting
relaxing and contracting again
knew now where the letter was she
as well as if
long and narrow like an advertisement but
in the corner in large letters it
war department and in smaller letters
official business she knew
lay there in the big bowl with
uncertainly she walked toward the dining room
moment she found the light
the electric light in crimson squares
with black and yellow squares edged with
forward and paused again another step and
would see over the
step and she would see an edge
white another step her
moment she was tearing it
it before her while the
page glared out and struck
her then it fluttered
a bird to the floor the house
was suddenly very quiet a breath of
crept in through the open
door carrying the noise of a
motor she heard faint sounds from upstairs
the pipe behind the bookcases her husband
as if this were not after
donald s hour except in
far as he was
on in sudden surges and
this cold malignant thing of beauty
gift of enmity from a man
centre of her house as
had lain for years throwing
each into each never
never changing evylyn sat down on the
of the table and stared
it fascinated it seemed to be
say you see this time i didn
have to hurt you directly i didn
bother you know it was i
took your son away you
how cold i am
suddenly to turn itself over and then
great canopy that glittered and trembled over
the walls melted slowly into
walked all the people and the light
refracted and twisted until shadow
clear bell it came from
centre of the bowl and down the
sides to the ground
you see i am fate it
out and i am
from your little dreams and
the end of beauty and unfulfilled desire
little minutes that shape the
hours are mine i
limits of your control the
in the dish of
echoes rolled away over the wide land
the edge of the
great sides and back
walls began slowly to bear down
closer and closer as
clinched her hands and waited for the
bowl gave a sudden wrench
turned over and lay there on the
of light the cold wind blew
again through to front door and
be quick she must be strong she
her arms until they ached tauted
thin strips of muscle
her soft flesh and
a mighty effort raised
and held it she felt the
blow cold on her back
strain of her effort and as
felt it she turned toward it and
under the great weight out through the
and on toward the front door she
be quick she must be strong the
in her arms throbbed
and her knees kept giving way under
but the feel of the cool
was good out the front door she
and over to the stone steps and
summoning every fibre of
soul and body for a last
swung herself half around for a
as she tried to loose
to the rough surface and in
second she slipped and losing balance
forward with a despairing
her arms still around
bowl down over the
lights went on far
pedestrians rushed up wonderingly up
a tired man awoke from the
of sleep and a little girl
in a haunted doze
black form hundreds of prisms and cubes
light in little gleams of
and black edged with yellow and yellow
crimson edged with black
on saturday night one could stand
country club windows as a yellow
over a very black and wavy ocean
waves of this ocean so
speak were the heads of
curious caddies a few of the more
chauffeurs the golf professional s deaf sister
waves who might have rolled inside
they so desired this
the gallery the balcony
chairs that lined the wall
the combination clubroom and ballroom
ladies with sharp eyes and
main function of the balcony
critical it occasionally showed grudging admiration
known among ladies over thirty five that
the younger set dance in the summer
it is with the very worst intentions
the world and if
are not bombarded with stony eyes stray
will dance weird barbaric interludes in the
girls will sometimes be kissed
dowagers but after all this critical
the stage to see the actors faces
of postulates such as
one which states that every
man with a large income leads
really appreciates the drama of the shifting
cruel world of adolescence no
by the medley of faces and voices
year old otis ormonde who has
more years at hill school to g
a harvard law diploma from little
on top of her head to bessie
who has been the
of the party a little too long
than ten years the medley is not
the centre of the stage but
the only people capable of
an unobstructed view of it
effortless smiles facetiously repeat la de da
of young feminine voices soars over
burst of clapping a few disappointed stags
in midfloor as they
listlessly back to the walls
dances these summer hops were considered
marrieds rose and performed
the tolerant amusement of their younger
and sisters warren mcintyre who casually attended
being one of the unfortunate
tables filling the lantern
night with vague words and hazy laughter
nodded here and there at the
each couple some half forgotten fragment of
story played in his mind for it
who s who to every one else
past there for example
jim strain and ethel demorest who had
one knew that as soon as
managed to hold a
for more than two months
would marry him yet how bored
both looked and how wearily
regarded jim sometimes as if she wondered
she had trained the vines of her
on such a wind shaken poplar
those of his friends who hadn t
it there was genevieve
house parties and football games
princeton yale williams and
quite as famous to
own generation as hiram
dazzling bewildering tongue was already
celebrated for having turned five cart
the street from marjorie had long
to reciprocate his feeling with a
gratitude but she had tried him by
her test was that when she was
from him she forgot
this discouraging especially as marjorie had
after each arrival home he
great heaps of mail
the harveys hall table addressed to her
claire and it seemed impossible to
her alone it was always necessary
hunt round and find some one to
care of bernice as august waned this
as warren worshipped marjorie he had
admit that cousin bernice was sorta
she was pretty with dark hair
night he danced a
to please marjorie but
had never been anything but bored in
company warren a soft voice
his elbow broke in upon his thoughts
he turned to see marjorie
and radiant as usual she laid a
on his shoulder and a glow
almost imperceptibly over him warren
whispered do something for me dance
warren s glow faded why sure
do you i ll see that you
you re an angel and i
but bernice and otis
not in sight he wandered back
and there in front of
women s dressing room
a piece of timber he had picked
and discoursing volubly she s
in to fix her hair
to dance another hour
her their laughter was renewed why
otis resentfully she likes more
why otis suggested a friend you ve
two by four otis
oh this this is a
when she comes out i
hit her on the head and knock
in again warren collapsed on a
and howled with glee never
relieving you this time otis simulated
to warren if you need it
man he said hoarsely no
a dance unfortunate perhaps boys
with whom they dance a
times an but youth in this jazz
generation is temperamentally restless and
idea of fox trotting
than one full fox trot with
same girl is distasteful not
say odious when it comes to
dances and the intermissions between she can
will never tread on
wayward toes again warren danced
her to a table on the
there was a moment
eau claire she said warren stifled a
and nodded it might be for
wondered idly whether she was a poor
because she got no
or got no attention because she was
poor conversationalist you going to
here much longer he asked
then turned rather red she
if to lunge at his next
then with a sudden charitable
he decided to try part of
line on her he
and looked at her eyes you
got an awfully kissable
he began quietly this was a
that he sometimes made to girls at
distinctly jumped she turned an ungraceful red
fresh the word had
out before she realized
and she bit her
too late she decided to
amused and offered him
flustered smile warren was annoyed though
accustomed to have that remark taken
still it usually provoked
sentimental banter and he hated to
called fresh except in a joking way
the topic jim strain and ethel demorest
out as usual he commented this was
in bernice s line but
subject changed men did
but she knew that
talked in some such way
other girls oh yes she said
laughed i hear they ve been
around for years without a red
isn t it silly warren
disgust increased jim strain was
close friend of his
s and anyway he considered it bad
to sneer at people
no intention of sneering she
merely nervous ii when
half after midnight they said good night
though cousins they were
no female intimates she considered girls stupid
parent arranged visit had rather longed
felt somehow the same difficulty in talking
to men marjorie never giggled
never frightened seldom embarrassed and in
had very few of the qualities which
considered appropriately and blessedly
as bernice busied herself with
brush and paste this night she
for the hundredth time why
family were the wealthiest
her a car of her own to
success like most girls she had
mysterious womanly qualities always mentioned but never
not at present engaged in being
not been for marjorie
evening with one man but she knew
even in eau claire other girls with
position and less pulchritude
it had never worried her and if
that the other girls cheapened
she turned out the light in
bathroom and on an
light was still on
soft slippers bore her noiselessly
the carpeted hall but
voices inside she stopped
she caught her own name and without
definite intention of eavesdropping lingered and the
inside pierced her consciousness sharply as if
had been drawn through
a needle she s
hopeless it was marjorie s voice
i know what you re going
say so many people have told you
pretty and sweet she is and how
can cook what of it she has
re eighteen said marjorie emphatically
been polite and i
made men dance with her but
bored when i think of that gorgeous
and think what martha carey
that modern situations were too much for
when she was a girl all young
who belonged to nice families
glorious times well said marjorie no
can permanently bolster up a lame duck
because these days it s every
hints about clothes and
and she s been furious given me
funniest looks she s
with much but i ll
very virtuous and that i
too gay and fickle and will come
a bad end all unpopular
think that way sour grapes sarah hopkins
to genevieve and roberta and me as
girls i ll bet she
give ten years of her
and her european education
be a gardenia girl and
three or four men in love with
and be cut in
it seems to me
you ought to be
to do something for bernice
know she s not very
marjorie groaned vivacious good
i ve never heard
that it s hot or the floor
going to school in
york next year sometimes
and tells them the kind
has thrilling there was a
silence and then mrs harvey
up her refrain all i know is
the place for her she
dancing herself to death but
witty and an awfully slick girl
roberta s a marvellous dancer she
been popular for ages mrs harvey yawned
marjorie maybe she s a reversion
type indian women all
laughed mrs harvey i wouldn t have
you that if i d thought you
going to remember it and
think most of your ideas are perfectly
silence while marjorie considered whether
permanently convinced of anything
eighteen our convictions are hills
they are caves in which we hide
decided this marjorie said good night when
was breakfasting late next
with a rather formal good morning sat
opposite stared intently over and
moistened her lips what s
your mind inquired marjorie rather
bernice paused before she threw
hand grenade i heard what you
about me to your mother last
marjorie was startled but she
she spoke where were you
marjorie dropped her eyes
claire if i m such a
note i ve tried to
me and got such
marjorie was silent but
m in the way i see i
a drag on you your friends don
like me she paused and then
another one of her grievances of
i was furious last week when
tried to hint to me that that
i know how to dress myself
murmured less than half aloud what i
succinctly i said as i remember
a becoming dress three times
than to alternate it with
frights do you think that was
very nice thing to say
wasn t trying to
nice then after a pause
drew in her breath sharply oh
were going yes but oh you were
bluffing they stared at each other
the breakfast table for
moment misty waves were passing before
that rather hard expression that she used
slightly intoxicated undergraduate s were making
as if it were
she might have expected
admitted it by bursting
tears marjorie s eyes showed boredom you
v visiting you i
to stay a month and if i
sniffles i ll give you
month s allowance she said coldly and
there s a very nice hotel bernice
sobs rose to a flute note and
an hour later while
was in the library absorbed in composing
of those non committal marvelously elusive letters
only a young girl can
calm she cast no glance at
but took a book at
down as if to read marjorie
the clock showed noon bernice closed her
with a snap i suppose i
of the speech she
getting her cues wasn
urging her to be
it s an a mistake
was the best opening
letter said marjorie without looking
i want to get it
in the next mail after
minute during which her
scratched busily she turned round
service again bernice had
speak do you want me to go
well said marjorie considering i
if you re not having
use being miserable don t
quote little women cried marjorie impatiently that
out of style you
so heavens yes what
mothers were all very well in
way but they know very little about
t talk about my mother marjorie laughed
don t think i mentioned
bernice felt that she was being led
from her subject do
think you ve treated me
well i ve done
bernice s eyes reddened
you are responsible for all the tiresome
marriages all those ghastly inefficiencies that
as feminine qualities what a blow
must be when a
with imagination marries the beautiful bundle of
that he s been
the womanly woman continued marjorie her whole
criticisms of girls like
who really do have a good time
s jaw descended farther
marjorie s voice rose
s some excuse for an ugly girl
if i d been
me into the world but you re
to weep with you you ll be
you like and picking up her
she left the room bernice claimed a
and failed to appear
for the afternoon but the headache
marjorie made explanation to a not very
boy but when she returned
in the afternoon she found bernice
a strangely set face waiting for
in her bedroom i ve
began bernice without preliminaries that
possibly not but if
ll tell me why
friends aren t aren
if i can do what
want me to marjorie
at the mirror shaking down her hair
you mean it yes without reservations
you do exactly what i say
i say if they re
things they re not you
if i tell you to take boxing
you ll have to
it write home and tell
mother you re going to stay
manner why because you re never
about your personal appearance when a girl
that she s perfectly groomed and
she can forget that part
her that s charm
to forget the more
you have don t
instance you never take care
they re a blemish they d
care of them in one tenth
time you take doing
you re going to brush them so
in question do you mean
subconsciously and when you go home you
to have your teeth
a little it s almost
still but i thought interrupted bernice
bewilderment that you despised little dainty
things like that i hate
minds answered marjorie but a
person if she looks like a
there s your dancing don
you lean on a
noticed it when we were dancing
up straight instead of bending over a
once told you that you looked
dignified that way but
s much harder on
man and he s the one that
go on bernice s brain was reeling
you ve got to learn to
been insulted whenever you re thrown with
i m cut in on every
feet and who does most of it
those very sad birds
girl can afford to neglect
they re the big
to talk are the very best conversational
follow a baby tank across a barb
but marjorie was not through if you
to a dance and
amuse say three sad birds that dance
you if you talk so well to
you ve done something they
come back next time and
so many sad birds will
with you that the
boys will see there
no danger of being stuck then
to see and finally concluded
poise and charm will
morning knowing you ve
it and men will know it too
rose it s been awfully
me like this before and
made no answer but gazed
mirror you re a peach
help me continued bernice still
did not answer and bernice
don t like sentiment she
timidly marjorie turned to her quickly oh
wasn t thinking about
i was considering whether
hadn t better bob
evening there was a dinner dance
the country club when the
strolled in bernice found her place card
the all important left held only
paulson charley lacked height beauty
social shrewdness and in
new enlightenment bernice decided that his
qualification to be her partner was
he had never been
with her but this feeling
plates and marjorie s specific instruction
i ought to bob
hair mr charley paulson charley
up in surprise why because
m considering it it s
charley smiled pleasantly he could
know this had been rehearsed he replied
want to be a society vampire
necessary prelude she added that she wanted
heard he was so critical
psychology of women as he did
ve decided she continued
voice rising slightly that early
week i m going down to
she faltered noticing that the people near
listening but after a confused second marjorie
large of course i m
admission but if you ll all come
under cover of it
reece stoddard leaned over quickly and said
eyes and smiled as
it s unmoral affirmed bernice gravely but
course you ve either
to amuse people or
intent looks from the girls and then
though she had said nothing of wit
moment bernice turned again
charley and spoke confidentially in his ear
want to ask you
opinion of several people i imagine you
a wonderful judge of character charley thrilled
paid her a subtle
while warren mcintyre was
passively in the stag line
watching the dancers and wondering
and with whom marjorie
disappeared an unrelated perception began to
cut in on several times
the past five minutes he
looked again several minutes
she had been dancing
a visiting boy would
some one else and there was
paulson headed for her with enthusiastic determination
his eye funny charley seldom danced
evening warren was distinctly
when the exchange having
none ether than g
stoddard himself and g reece
not at all jubilant at being
next time bernice danced
warren regarded her intently yes
was pretty distinctly pretty and
night her face seemed really vivacious she
that look that no woman
liked the way she
her hair arranged wondered if
was brilliantine that made
was becoming a dark
that set off her shadowy eyes
high coloring he remembered that he
first came to town before he had
that she was dull too bad
was dull dull girls unbearable
pretty though his thoughts zigzagged back
marjorie this disappearance would be like
disappearances when she reappeared
would demand where she
she defied him to fall
love with genevieve or
warren sighed the way
he looked up bernice was again dancing
the visiting boy half
the stag line in her
and hesitated then he said to
that it was charity he walked toward
collided suddenly with g reece stoddard
on bernice that night at
o clock marjorie with one
on the electric light switch in
look at bernice s sparkling eyes so
was that about midnight i ran
different men of course i hope
won t compare notes men don t
marjorie yawning and it wouldn t
out the light and as they started
the stairs bernice grasped
banister thankfully for the first time in
life she had been danced tired you
the stairs one man sees
must be something there well we ll
up some new stuff to morrow
down her hair she passed
followed instructions exactly even when
or eau claire or automobiles
her conversation to me
and us but a few
before she fell asleep a rebellious thought
marjorie to be sure had given her
much of her conversation out of things
read bernice had bought the red
though she had never valued it
of her trunk and her own voice
smiled her own feet had danced
nice girl vain though
what s his name warren she fell
numerous mistakes at first she
draycott deyo was studying
the ministry she was unaware that
had cut in on her because
girl had she known these
him to the line which began
shell shock and continued
the bathtub story it takes
frightful lot of energy to fix my
in the summer there s so
of it so i always
i get into the bathtub
dress afterward don t
plan though draycott deyo was
the throes of difficulties
baptism by immersion and might
admitted that he did not he considered
of his ideas on the depravity of
bernice had several signal successes to her
little otis ormonde pleaded off from a
east and elected instead
the amusement of his crowd and
disgusting tenderness of the glances
bent on bernice he even
by four and the dressing room
show her how frightfully mistaken he
every one else had been in their
judgment of her bernice laughed off that
bernice s conversation perhaps the best known
most universally approved was the line about
bernice when you goin to
m counting on you you
hurry up bernice whose
intentions were strictly dishonorable
the most significant symbol of her success
the gray car of
hypercritical warren mcintyre parked daily in front
for bernice instead of marjorie
a week of it she
the cook that miss bernice had
holda miss marjorie s best fella and
bernice had perhaps it began with
s desire to rouse jealousy
strain of marjorie in bernice
conversation perhaps it was
of these and something
sincere attraction besides but somehow
a week that marjorie s most reliable
moment was how marjorie
phone twice a day sent her
and they were frequently seen together in
roadster obviously engrossed in one
those tense significant conversations as to whether
twitted only laughed she
she was mighty glad that
set laughed too and guessed
marjorie didn t care and let it
were only three days left of her
bernice was waiting in the hall
mood and when marjorie also
for anything in the nature of
clash marjorie did her work
coldly and succinctly in three
out of your head she said
his fingers about you
other marjorie scornful aloof
cars drove up in front of
side hurried out all through
bridge party bernice strove
vain to master a rising uneasiness
innocent intentions in the world she had
marjorie s property she felt suddenly and
guilty after the bridge game when
sat in an informal
ormonde inadvertently precipitated it
you going back to kindergarten
s over said marjorie
that s only a bluff of hers
should think you d have realized that
fact demanded otis giving bernice a
glance bernice s ears
as she tried to think
an effectual come back
the face of this
d be young enough to know that
well said otis maybe so but
with a line like
s really yawned marjorie what
trifled with her muse s beau had
a line asked roberta curiously bernice
she felt that wit in some form
demanded of her but under
completely incapacitated i don t
it bernice saw that warren s eyes
tinkering with and were fixed on
questioningly oh i don t know she
remarked marjorie again come through bernice
otis tell her where
get off bernice looked round again she
unable to get away from
s eyes i like bobbed hair she
hurriedly as if he had
suggested roberta otis jumped
we ll have a summer
party sevier hotel barber shop
think you said in an instant all
on their feet bernice
heart throbbed violently what she
out of the group came
s voice very clear and contemptuous
t worry she ll
toward the door four eyes warren
and marjorie s stared at her
her defied her for another
she wavered wildly all right she said
beside warren the others following in
the sensations of marie antoinette bound for
guillotine in a tumbrel
that it was all
keep from clutching her hair with
world yet she did
deterrent now this was
test supreme of her sportsmanship
right to walk unchallenged in the
heaven of popular girls
was moodily silent and
they came to the
he drew up at the curb and
to bernice to precede him out roberta
car emptied a laughing crowd
plate glass windows to the
bernice stood on the
barber shop it was a guillotine
who attired in a white coat and
a cigarette leaned non chalantly against
first chair he must have heard of
fold her no but they
tie a white cloth round
right bernice said warren quickly
her chin in the
open the swinging screen
and giving not a glance to the
my hair bob it refusing further preliminaries
the chair next to her turned
lather half amazement one barber
and swore musically in
gaelic as a razor
into his cheek two bootblacks became wide
and rushed for her feet
a couple joined him
a dozen small boys nose
into life flattened against the
and snatches of conversation borne on the
breeze drifted in through
screen door lookada long hair
a kid where d yuh get at
at s a bearded lady
just finished shavin but bernice saw nothing
nothing her only living sense
her that this man in the
coat had removed one tortoise
comb and then another
hairpins that this hair this wonderful
of hers was going she
never again feel its long
pull as it hung
a dark brown glory
ironic smile as if to say
you see you haven t got
prayer and some last energy rose up
bernice for she clinched her
under the white cloth and there
and she flinched at the full
blocks on both sides
known it would be
charm had been a madonna like simplicity
that was gone and
was well frightfully mediocre not
only ridiculous like a
villager who had left her spectacles
home as she climbed down from
chair she tried to smile
the girls exchange glances noticed
that warren s eyes were suddenly
cold you see her words fell into
awkward pause i ve done it
you ve done it admitted
do you like it there
warren would you mind
me down to the
a dress there before supper
can take the others warren
then for an instant his
to marjorie be glad to
fully realize the outrageous trap that had
aunt s amazed glance just before
why bernice i ve bobbed it
josephine why child do you
it why bernice i suppose i ve
mrs deyo think tomorrow
bernice you should have waited until
if you wanted to
to mrs deyo particularly why child cried
harvey in her paper
she read at the last meeting
the thursday club she devoted fifteen minutes
oh bernice what ll your
say she ll think
let you do it
made a hasty attempt with a
iron and burned her
and much hair she could see that
grieved and her uncle
saying well i ll
darned over and over in
hurt and faintly hostile torte and
sat very quietly intrenched behind a faint
a faintly mocking smile somehow she
through the evening three boy s called
disappeared with one of them
had undressed for the night the door
and marjorie came in
about the deyo dance i ll
all about it sall
said bernice shortly standing before the
hair i ll take you
town to morrow continued marjorie
the hairdresser ll fix it so you
d go through with it i m
mighty sorry oh sall
still it s your last night
much then bernice winced as marjorie
began to twist it
her cream colored negligee she looked
a delicate painting of some saxon princess
bernice watched the braids
heavy and luxurious they were moving
the supple fingers like restive snakes and
curling iron and a to
full of eyes she
liked her assuming his harvard manner
have been allowed to
to the movies so much she
little note requesting that
know that marjorie had made a
beauty had been sacrificed
the jealous whim of
selfish girl she sat down suddenly before
mirror biting the inside of
s sake don t
it worry you i won t
feet clinching her hands then swiftly and
crossed over to her
quickly dumped in two drawerfulls
moved quietly but deadly efficiency and in
quarters of an hour her trunk
locked and strapped and
was fully dressed in a becoming
travelling suit that marjorie had helped her
reasons for going she sealed it
it and laid it on her pillow
glanced at her watch the
left at one and she
to the marborough hotel two
a taxicab suddenly she
in her breath sharply
an expression flashed into
connected vaguely with the set look she
quite a new look for
and it carried consequences she went
to the bureau picked up an
the quiet even breathing
an untroubled conscience asleep she was by
swiftly bending over she found
hair followed it up
her hand to the point
the head and then holding it a
would feel no pull she reached
with the shears and severed
with the pigtail in her hand she
her breath marjorie had muttered something
other braid paused for an
and then flitted swiftly and silently back
opened the big front
closed it carefully behind
and feeling oddly happy and
her heavy grip like a
brisk walk she discovered that
left hand still held the two
mouth hard to keep from emitting an
peal she was passing warren
impulse she set down her
and swinging the braids
longer restraining herself huh she giggled wildly
the selfish thing then picking up
staircase she set off at a
run down the moonlit street
the baltimore station was hot
the telegraph desk for interminable
seconds while a clerk
big front teeth counted and recounted
whether it contained the innocuous forty
life ever meant me to be if
ve always been in tune with but
can t lois we can
and let all this glorious love end
been sitting here in
half dark and thinking where i
go and ever forget you
perhaps to drift through
or spain and dream away the pain
of older mellower civilizations
mirror only the desolation of
heart and then your
came sweetest bravest girl if you
wire me i ll meet
the letter so many
it she found many
it the mingled sweetness and sadness
his dark eyes the furtive
to her his dreamy sensuousness that
her mind to sleep lois was
and very romantic and curious and
clerk having compromised on
telegram and there were
overtones to the finality
thought it s just the
holding back so we
her telegram arrived baltimore today
p m wednesday love lois
four cents said the clerk
trees like tall languid ladies
feather fans coquetting airily with the ugly
of the monastery trees like
bending courteously over placid walks and
trees trees over the hills
and lines and woods all through eastern
delicate lace on the hems
young but the monastery trees were older
t very old at
it wasn t technically called
monastery but only a seminary nevertheless it
be a monastery here despite its victorian
or its edward vii
or even its woodrow
patented last a century
out behind was the
where half a dozen
moved with deadly efficiency around
vegetable gardens to the left behind a
of elms was an
baseball diamond where three novices were
batted out by a fourth amid
chasings and puffings and blowings
checker board of paths under
courteous trees some of
black leaves were very old
of a splashed pool then
gowns were beginning to be
of thomas aquinas and henry james
conscientious expressions men in
late twenties with a keen self assurance
and virginia and west virginia
delaware there were many americans
some irish and some tough irish
a few french and several italians
poles and they walked informally
long rows almost universally distinguished
the straight mouth and the considerable
founded in spain five hundred years
by a tough minded soldier who trained
to hold a breach
a salon preach a sermon
of a bus into
sunshine down by the outer gate
was nineteen with yellow hair
eyes that people were tactful enough
to call green when men of talent
furtively produced little stub pencils and backs
envelopes and tried to
up that profile or the thing
the eyebrows did to her eyes later
looked at their results and usually
them up with wondering
though lois was very jauntily attired in
not linger to pat out the
which covered her clothes but started up
central walk with curious glances
at all that glorified
was wondering what he
in the picture which hung over
mother s bureau at
he seemed very young and
cheeked and rather pitiful with only
ill fitting probationer s gown to
decision about his life of course he
been only nineteen then and
look like that at all in recent
of her brother she had always retained
that of the big picture and
she had always been a little
for him what a
for a man seventeen years of preparation
he wasn t even a priest
was going to give her very
imitation of undiluted sunshine the imitation she
give even when her
was splitting or when her
she was particularly romantic and curious
courageous this brother of hers
needed cheering up and he
going to be cheered up whether he
it or not as
drew near the great homely front door
pulling up the skirts of his
run toward her he was smiling she
and he looked very
and and reliable she
and waited knew that
heart was beating unusually fast lois
cried and in a
she was in his arms she was
trembling lois he cried again why this
how much i ve looked forward to
his voice though restrained was vibrant
energy and that odd sort of enveloping
she had thought that she only
the family possessed i m mighty glad
kieth she flushed but not unhappily at
lois he repeated in wonder child
ll go in here
rector and then we ll
things to talk to you about
voice became graver how
mother she looked at him for a
and then said something that she
very sort of thing she had resolved
avoid oh kieth she s she s
worse all the time
way he nodded slowly as
he understood nervous well you
tell me about that later now
was in a small
with a large desk saying something to
some seconds so this is lois
said it as if he had
of her for years he entreated
to sit down two
kieth s little sister which she
how assured they seemed she had expected
were several jokes unintelligible to her which
to delight every one and the little
rector referred to the trio of
as dim old monks
monks at all she had a lightning
that they were especially fond of
had kept a hand
his shoulder all through the conversation
cream and smiling and smiling and being
that it was because kieth was so
she and kieth were
along a path arm in arm and
was informing her what an absolute
the father rector was
he broken off suddenly i want to
it means to me to have
sweet of you i know what a
time you ve been having
gasped she was not prepared for this
first when she had conceived
to baltimore staying the
with a friend and then
out to see her
she had felt rather consciously
hoped he wouldn t
priggish or resentful about her
having come before but walking here
him under the trees
such a little thing and surprisingly a
i saw you when
remember and how could i have gone
without practically ever having seen
only brother it was
sweet of you lois he repeated lois
he did have personality i
you to tell me
about yourself he said
a pause of course i have
were all so worried
two years ago and then well
ve seen your name in the
unsatisfactory i haven t
you lois she found herself
his personality as she analyzed
if the effect of of
constant repetition of her name
the word as if it had
were at school he continued yes at
but he only nodded slowly
in the nicest ones there are
many common girls he nodded again
he agreed i suppose there are and
know how you feel about it
grated on me here
to any one but
we re rather sensitive you and
to things like this you
the men here yes some
men i d always been thrown
but there were others a man named
now he s about the best friend
have a wonderful character
you ll meet him
to have with you
a fight lois was thinking that
was the sort of man she
fight how did you how did you
happen to do it
i mean of course mother told me
you tell it oh it s nothing
what you probably know it was evening
thinking about about a hundred
lois and then suddenly i had
across from me felt
time and had a vague idea
he was another traveller
at once he leaned over
me and i heard a voice
i want you to be a
that s what i
well i jumped up and
an idiot of myself before about
people you see there wasn t any
sitting there at all
week after that i went
the jesuit college in
rector s office on
hands and knees there
s eyes wore a far away
the sudden silence that seemed to flow
him when he finished
she noticed now that
eyes were of the same fibre as
that his mouth was much gentler
than in the picture
awful for a man to grow
and no one to care about
were you pious when you were young
she asked you know what i
he said with his eyes still
away and she felt that his
abstraction was as much
part of his personality as his attention
i suppose i was when i
he nodded i was on the way
making a bad hash of things he
and turning his gray
on her changed the subject
been awfully hard for you there lately
lot and put up
a great deal and
i think it is i feel
that you re sort of taking the
of both of us there lois thought
she had constantly avoided her nervous
steadily i know he sighed
you oughtn t to have the
i were there to help you
saw how quickly he
this quality was that he gave off
of on a side track and
she broke the silence
an odd remark sweetness is
she said suddenly what nothing she denied
to speak aloud i was
of something of a conversation
kebble s brother yes she said rather
to think of him having known maury
still there was nothing strange about
well he and i were talking
sweetness a few weeks
a man i knew
sweet and he didn t
with me and we began talking about
sweetness in a man
he kept telling me i meant
sort of soppy softness but i knew
how to put it i see
sort of hardness and
kieth nodded i see what you
i m talking about young
she said rather defiantly they had
the now deserted baseball
and pointing her to a wooden bench
don t they look happy lois
two we just passed
they are they are they signed up
outside like you did he
they don t know what they
doing they haven t
no i suppose not
doesn t seem fair life
no some of them
knocked around led pretty
think that sort would be better she
meditatively men that had seen life
said kieth earnestly i m
communicate to others some of the broadest
i ve known have
absolutely rigid about themselves and
libertines are a notoriously intolerant class don
and he continued it seems to
that when one weak reason goes to
it isn t help they want
were born when mother began
get nervous she used to
and weep with a certain
comstock lord it used to make
shiver she said it comforted her
others you ve got
comes from a stronger person whom
respect and their sympathy
all the bigger because it s impersonal
been tempted lois in
hearts they want to feel that the
person s been weak
this old monkery lois he continued with
self pity and pride in our
wills out of us
by losing it you see we sort
feel that the less
human the better servant he can
out to the end too
one of us dies his family
t even have him then he
buried here under plain wooden cross with
thousand others his tone changed
in a man s
there are some things he
t get rid of an one
them is that i m awfully in
the grass and leaning
hard kieth she said
the reception room lois met
half dozen more of kieth s particular
jarvis rather pale and
grandson of old mrs jarvis
this ascetic with a
followed her about the
with something very like worship she knew
what kieth had meant about a
vaguely china or something i want
the shimmy is demanded one
father rector would send me
an expert i m sure
wouldn t be best
jimmy s soul anyway said
solemnly he s inclined to brood
he became a monk and
haunted him his whole first
was peeling potatoes putting his arm
his feet there was a
this ice cream whispered jarvis
cover of the laugh because she d
you were coming it
iv then half an hour later over
the chapel things suddenly
all wrong it was several
since lois had been at benediction
at first she was thrilled
of white the air rich and
with incense and the sun
francis xavier overhead and falling in warm
weight seemed to descend upon her soul
was on her right and young
on her left and
stole uneasy glance at both
them what s the matter with me
thought impatiently she looked again was
a certain coldness in
their profiles that she had
noticed before a pallor about the
from kieth s this was
little laugh what is the matter with
she passed her hand
her eyes and the weight increased the
sickened her and a stray
note from one of
tenors in the choir grated on
ear like the shriek of a slate
her forehead found moisture on it it
hot in here hot as
was all wrong wrong why
t somebody see it there
something in it there was something coming
she tried to fight
her rising panic told
t straight candles did something but they
t do this with incalculable
a force was gathering within
a tremendous assimilative force drawing
every sense every corner
surged up inside her she
her arms in close
her side away from kieth
forward in another moment she
she would go forward toward it
slowly left the altar
the hands of the priest
heard a great rushing noise
like hammer blows and then in a
her heart there was a
there and a lashing as of waves
lips mouthing the words that would
come kieth oh my god kieth suddenly
it was the window of st francis
her mind gripped at it clung
a gradual rumble sounded
response rolling heavily through the
blessed be god the words sang instantly
peaceful upon the air and the
holy name everything blurred into
swinging mist with a
half gasp half cry she
kieth s suddenly outstretched arms v
eyes again she was on
head with a cold towel i
but just lie still a minute
felt it too she laughed as
she repeated but though a warm peace
she felt oddly broken and
as if some one had
on kieth s arm
sick lois kieth i m
worry poor old child i
t realize that benediction
be a long service for you after
hot trip out here
all she laughed cheerfully
used to benediction mass is the limit

first class minds never believe anything very
it as depressing this prelude
young man who lived

dalyrimple drifted out of adolescence
a mighty fan fare of trumpets
romp behind the retreating german lines
luck triumphant or sentiment rampant awarded
general pershing and sergeant york
governor of his state a stray congressman
a citizens committee gave him enormous smiles
by god sirs on the dock
hoboken there were newspaper
and photographers who said would you mind
if you could just and back
as they talked to him and girls
hadn t remembered him so well
died he realized that for a
he had been the house guest
in the world and that the
that will live forever in the annals

up stairs maid said that mrs
the mayor s wife had been trying
a week to hint

o clock in intolerable confusion asking
his trunk be sent to mrs
twenty three and he had
worked his father had
him two years at the state university
passed away about the time of his
s nine day romp

dalyrimple had very keen gray eyes
mind that delighted the army

when he realized that
had to go to work right away
the office of theron
macy who owned the
wholesale grocery house in town plump
wearing a pleasant but quite
how do bryan what s
your mind to dalyrimple straining with
of a job this question of a
a job an almost imperceptible breeze blew
mr macy s expression you

interrupted mr macy what were
well just at the first

the battalion paraded mr peter jordan

then we ve filled it he cleared
everybody told me there was
mr macy delivered a paragraph

this neatly and then continued what do

the office for a while then you
go on the road when could

he continued to regard dalyrimple steadily
well mr macy i m certainly
himself in the hall
forehead was covered with perspiration
a gun he muttered iii next morning
seven every morning and
him for instruction into the hands
a fellow worker one charley
of weakness hanging about him that
it took no psychological examiner
indulgence and laziness as casually as he
drifted into life and was to drift
clothes stank of smoke he
burlesque shows billiards and robert service
was always looking back
run to loud ties but now it
to have faded like his
and was expressed in pale lilac
was listlessly struggling that
struggle against mental moral
physical anaemia that takes
ceaselessly on the lower fringe of the
classes the first morning he stretched himself
a row of cereal cartons and carefully
over the limitations of
organization my gosh lookit what
months hell me stay with this bunch
change jobs next month they
once or twice in their
after which they sit around
their last job with the
the latter what do you
asked dalyrimple curiously me i
at thirty five he
me he d put me
the road after i learned
stock that s what he tells
me four years my last year too
bet your boots dalyrimple rather resented the
of the store detective
into contact with him almost
was a thorn in his
or four cigarettes in
followed charley moore by a circuitous route
a flight of back stairs to a
balcony where they indulged in peace but
met him in a
of the stairs on
descent and told him sternly that
dalyrimple felt like an errant schoolboy unpleasant
had worked there for ten or fifteen
at sixty dollars a month rolling
times a month to
cigarette case and a pair of
glasses and managed to
was however a narrow scrape as
ways and means of economy were
closed book to him and the second
you ve got a
ll raise you was
raise me till i d been here
two years i ve
railroad but golly i want to

his head sceptically and mr macy
before closing time mr
i d like to
resentful i want to
to you in regard
more salary mr macy nodded
he said doubtfully i don t know
what you re doing
knew exactly what dalyrimple was doing and
knew he knew i
in the stock room
to ask you how
longer i ll have to stay
why i m not sure
time to learn the stock you told
two months when i started
hanson dalyrimple paused irresolute thank you sir
of a count that had been
a salary list dalyrimple
donahoe everett his eyes stopped
$60 so tom everett macy
weak chinned nephew had
at sixty and in three
was it he was to sit
see man after man
over him sons cousins sons of friends
of their capabilities while
was cast for a pawn with
of with the stock remark i ll
i ll look into it at
perhaps he would be a
like old hesse tired listless hesse
a dull routine for
stint and a dull background
boarding house conversation this
have pressed into his hand
book for disillusioned young
but the book has not
written a great protest
into revolt surged up
him ideas half forgotten chaoticly
was the rule of life and that
all how he did
didn t matter but to
t he cried aloud
bookkeeper and the stenographers looked
in surprise what for a second dalyrimple
face expressed surprise it didn
rut in a dream he stepped from
an unused aisle sat down on a
hands his brain was whirring with
frightful jar of discovering a platitude for
of this he said
mean only out of
at five thirty it was
rain but he struck
in the opposite direction
his boarding house feeling
the first cool moisture that oozed soggily
and freshness he wanted
world that was like walking through rain
though he could not
far ahead of him but fate had
him in the world of
macy s fetid storerooms and corridors at
him then half plans began to formulate
bigger people people who ll
me interesting work somewhere my god there
be with sickening truth it
to him that his facility for meeting
was limited of all places
was here in his own
had to cut corners that was all
relationship wealthy marriages for
miles the continued reiteration
this preoccupied him and
he perceived that the rain had become
and more opaque in the
falling away the district
full blocks then of
houses then of scattering little ones passed
great sweeps of misty
walking here the sidewalk had
place to a dirt road
around his shoes cutting corners the words
little illuminated pieces of
they resolved into sentences each of which
a strangely familiar ring cutting
duty that evil was necessarily punished or
happier than corrupt riches it
being hard this phrase appealed to him
he repeated it over and
mr macy and charley moore
was drenched to the skin
place in the fence where a tree
years he thought they told me that
was a sort of dirty hue
but it seems to me that
environment or being found
dubs like charley moore as certainly
it does in the
of macy and if it ever gets
more tangible it becomes merely
arbitrary label to paste on the
it isn t worth worrying over
s evil and what isn
good and evil aren t any standard
a devil of a bad hindrance when
want something when i want something
get caught and then suddenly dalyrimple
what he wanted first he
fifteen dollars to pay
jumped from the fence
cut with his knife a piece
five inches square he made two holes
down to hold it in
dampened and clung clung to his forehead
cheeks now the twilight had merged to
waiting to remove the mask but
jagged eye holes he was
conscious of any nervousness the
to do the thing as soon as
he reached the first sidewalk
on until he saw a
far from any lamp post and turned
behind it within a
he heard several series
footsteps he waited it was a
and he held his
until she passed and
a man a laborer the next
the laborer s footfalls died far
the drenched street other steps
man stopped uttered an absurd little grunt
went through the waistcoat now
shrimp he said setting his hand suggestively
his own hip pocket you run
sudden uncontrollable laughter as audibly frightened
a moment he thrust the roll of
his mask and running quickly across the
justified himself intellectually he
kept raising riot with his attitude he
lunch room with charley moore
watching him unspread the paper
for a remark about the hold
of the day before but either the
up was not mentioned or
wasn t interested he turned
took in an editorial on ambition
his mouth slightly ajar and then
to mutt and jeff poor
with his faint aura of
and his mind that
with cast off mischief yet
belonged on the other
of the fence in him could be
up all the flamings and
at a stage heroine
lost virtue he could become lofty and
any resting places a man
s a strong criminal is after
me he thoughts with a
of life with the
mean eventual barrenness eventual
he would fling his mind upon the
and stand there with the flashing
of his pride other men
charity lied to all the
he at any rate would not lie
himself he was more
don juan not the philosophical
of his own century defying
sentimental a priori forms of
of the normal appetites and he had
strong conviction that the materials if not
inspiration of happiness could be
with money v the night came that
him out upon his second venture
as he walked the
street he felt in himself
great resemblance to a cat a certain
sleekly under his spare healthy flesh he
to run dodging among
to tarn cart wheels over soft grass
was not crisp but in
the moon is down i have not
delight at the line which an early
had endowed with a hushed
another a quarter of mile
for not having put in new
was the red brick sterner residence
marked the beginning of the avenue
was the jordon house the
been a guest the willoughbys the
street was a blot a man
possibly a policeman after an eternal second
found himself following the vague ragged shadow
bent very low then he
prey interminably he listened
in a demoniacal snarl and
felt his heart dip
faintest fragment of song far away strident
diagonally across the alley and crickets crickets
in the patched patterned moonlit grass
the yard within the house there
to lie an ominous silence he was
slight shiver hardened to
as leather gripping his
out knife and pliers he went
work on the screen
sure was he that
was unobserved that from the dining
where in a minute he
himself he leaned out
carefully pulled the screen up
position balancing it so it would
to a sudden exit then
put the open knife
and tiptoed around the room there
nothing here he could
included in his plans for the town
silver as a matter
fact his plans were of
in intelligence intuition and lightning decision
of a campaign the machine gun episode
taught him that and he was
wavering he stumbled slightly on a chair
his breath listened went on
the hall found the stairs started
the seventh stair creaked at his step
ninth the fourteenth he was counting
a minute and in that
he felt more alone than he had
even when alone he had
behind him the moral support of
a billion people now he was
he had never felt this fear yet
breathing his feet were
at stretching as he felt over the
pocketing all articles which held promise
garments women s lingerie
the same breathing enlivened by one ghastly
on its tour of his
round object watch chain roll
he remembered that he had got
from the other bureau he started
winced as a faint
flashed in front of him facing him
it was the glow of
found another he was all right
dollars in bills a platinum ring with
medium diamonds worth probably
up a cheap gold plated
with the initials o s and the
inside 03 probably a class
from school worth a few dollars unsalable
ivory chinese god probably
cents an small change he put the
in the toe of an infantry boot
a stocking in on top of
mind raced like a high power engine
past and future through fear
laughter with a vague inopportune
that he were married he fell
a deep sleep about half past
vi though the newspaper account
they worried him considerably the picture of
human waking in the cool dawn and
for them in vain of
voice calling the police
of weary dispirited visits to the dentist
or a woman he took
held them up near his mouth
moved his own jaws experimentally he
with his fingers but he failed to
they might belong either to a
mouthed woman or a
he wrapped them in
paper from the bottom of his army
letters then the next
he walked down philmore
and shied the package onto
lawn so that it would be near
door next day the paper
that the police had a
what the clew was vii at
bill of the silver district
the nurse girl s standby
frightening children five burglaries were attributed to
he considered that majority had
and appropriated the title to himself
had once been seen a large
creature with the meanest face you
at two o clock at the
of an electric torch flashed in her
she had waved flags
the daredevil type do you think
dalyrimple kept his imagination at white heat
managed to glorify his own attitude his
from petty scruples and remorses but let
once allow his thought to rove
go back to think out the
thing over again he found
to think of every one
toward mr macy underwent a change he
longer felt a dim animosity and inferiority
his presence as his fourth month
employer in a manner that
almost fraternal he had
vague but very assured conviction that
macy s innermost soul would
abetted and approved he no longer worried
several thousand dollars and then clearing out
east back to france down to south
the last two months he
been about to stop
but a fear of attracting attention to
being in funds prevented him so
worked on no longer in
but with contemptuous amusement
then with astounding suddenness something
that changed his plans
put an end to his burglaries
macy sent for him one afternoon
with a great show of
mystery asked him if
had an engagement that night if
alfred j fraser at eight o
with uncertainty he debated with himself whether
train out of town
that his fears were unfounded and at
o clock he arrived
the big fraser house in philmore
mr fraser was commonly
fraser his son in law was
demming and his influence
not wielded in such
way as to make
door of an upper lip
melange approaching a worthy climax
a long professional jaw during
conversation with dalyrimple his expression kept starting
imperturbability how do you do sir
down i suppose you re wondering
dalyrimple sat down mr dalyrimple how
mean you re foolish mr dalyrimple what
ve got to say won t
a proposition to begin
ever since last fourth of july when
made that speech in response to the
remembered it was a
speech straight from the shoulder and it
i know i ve
crowds for years he cleared his throat
crowds then continued but mr dalyrimple i
promised brilliantly go to pieces fail
want of steadiness too many high
to work so i waited i wanted
wanted to see if you d go
work and if you d stick to
macy told me you d started down
his place i kept watching you and
followed your record through
afraid for awhile he
me you were getting restless
a raise dalyrimple started but
said after that you evidently
up your mind to
up and stick to
stuff that wins out and don
think i don t understand i
you after all that silly flattery
lot of old women had been
you i know what
fight it must have been dalyrimple
face was burning brightly it
you ve got brains and you ve
the stuff in you
that s what i want i m
to put you into the
senate the what the
say state senate i don
stop there we re up against
some young men into
you know the old blood that s
running on the party
his lips you ll run me
the state senate i ll
you in the state senate mr fraser
nearest a smile and dalyrimple in a
frivolity felt himself urging
the jaw were separated by a
strait as a nail dalyrimple remembered with
effort that it was
mouth and talked to it but
m through he said my
mr fraser are mechanical linotype is
herald beginning next week
that is and his
no said dalyrimple looking him frankly
i ll take care of your
then just keep yourself on
right side of the
a phrase he had thought of
at the door bell
s macy now observed fraser rising i
go let him in the
have gone to bed he left dalyrimple
in a dream the world was
common sense that was the rule
more foolish risks now unless necessity
but it was being hard that
life be a sword of
that was drivel drivel he sprang
his feet with clinched hands
a sort of triumph well bryan said
macy stepping through the portieres the
older men smiled their half
at him well bryan
mr macy again dalyrimple smiled
how do mr macy he wondered
invisible realization mr macy held out his
i m glad we re to be
all along especially lately i
glad we re to be
the same side of the fence i
to thank you sir said dalyrimple simply
back of his eyes the four fists
the slightest desire to
a man over fifty is liable
be rather severely cracked
the impact of a
fist but for my
i am inclined to think that all
hitable qualities have quite vanished
it is certain that at
times in his life hitable qualities
in his face as surely
kissable qualities have ever lurked
a girl s lips
m sure every one has met a
like that been casually introduced even made
friend of him yet
he was the sort who aroused
dislike expressed by some
the involuntary clinching of fists and
in the juxtaposition of samuel meredith
features this quality was so strong
it influenced his entire life
for he was a pleasant looking man
that were frank and friendly yet
ve heard him tell
room full of reporters
for a success story that he d
that they wouldn t
it that it wasn
one story but four
the public would not
to read about a man who had
walloped into prominence it all
at phillips andover academy
and it was pure
had to delegate his
andover he was given
pet from the september day when
meredith s valet stowed samuel s clothing
the best bureau and asked
departing hif there was hanything
whose bowl has been put
good gosh he complained to his
contemporaries he s a
stuck up willie he
are the crowd here gentlemen and
and he said age didn
ole pieface for three weeks
endured in silence young
s comments on the clothes and habits
half feminine meannesses that show
a nervous mother can
to a boy if she keeps
crowd had gathered to hear gilly
wrathful about his roommate s latest sins
said oh i don t like the
open at night he said
only a little bit complained gilly don
let him boss you
t take turns shuttin em
t you i m
to gilly nodded his head
butler le s see
entered in person and
lo mer dith the
gave him a chilly glance and
on talking to gilly but samuel seemed
t you understand english this was adding
on the bed s sanitary
and the evidence within
of animal life s matter
your old bed demanded
truculently the bed s all right but
an your crazy ole bed he began
an your crazy go
it gilly murmured some one show the
fool samuel returned the
coolly well he said
touch you he ll
life samuel realized the insuperable inconvenience of
passionately detested he gazed around helplessly
the glowering violently hostile
t he was a coward for a
he stood there facing
s blazing eyes and
with a sudden choking sound he forced
way through the ring and rushed
the room the month
under the lashing tongues of his contemporaries
habits and mannerisms became
sensitiveness of adolescence was a
was a natural pariah that
for the christmas holidays
was so despondent that his father
him to a nerve specialist when
returned to andover he arranged
arrive late so that he could
alone in the bus during
drive from station to
of course when he had
to keep his mouth shut every one
forgot all about him the next
with his realization that consideration for others
memory by the beginning
his senior year samuel meredith
one of the best liked boys
his class and no one was
stronger for him than his first friend
samuel became the sort of college student
in the early nineties drove tandems and
and tallyhos between princeton and yale and
york city to show that
his own set he was
rather a snob but as
set was the set it never
him he played football in the
drank high balls in the winter
rowed in the spring
despised all those who were merely
without being sportsmen he
in new york and
the week end those
the days of the horse car
in case of a crush it was
to rise and deliver his seat to
intimates there were three vacant
and spreading a little as a tired
example and one young
was left at an embarrassed stance fourteen
seven lips curled slightly
the object of scorn stared stolidly into
foreground in sturdy unconsciousness of his
so conduct himself he spoke aloud
s a lady standing he
enough but the object of scorn
looked up blankly the standing
tittered and exchanged nervous glances with her
but samuel was aroused
s a lady standing he repeated
raspingly the man seemed to comprehend
turned red and his hands clinched
his friends he subsided into
left the car but so
the laborer who followed
samuel no longer resisted
aristocratic inclination he turned around and
a full featured dime novel sneer
a loud remark about the right
in a half second the workman
fly at him unprepared samuel took the
neatly on the jaw
me cried his assailant
been workin all day i m tired
sudden anger died out
his eyes and the mask of weariness
again over his face he turned and
wait samuel had risen slowly
was motioning back some time somewhere he
been struck like that
as he dusted himself off
whole scene in the room
man s strength his rest was
protection of his family he had
use for his seat in the
car than any young girl
s all right said
gruffly don t touch him
a week for samuel to rearrange his
form at first he simply admitted
had made him powerless against gilly
of imposing it upon
had faded out in a certain gutter
that year his class had somehow stopped
to him as a snob iii after
few years samuel s
decided that it had shone long
him in latin charged
turmoil with much self confidence a
friends and the proper assortment
harmless bad habits his family had by
a sudden decline in the sugar
vest so to speak when
went to work his mind
influence so he used his former
runner for a bank his diversion was
brunette who was married and lived in
little house in jersey city they had
on a ferry boat samuel
crossing from new york on
years by this time and
helped her look for a package
she had dropped in the crush
you come over often he inquired
shyly she had great
eyes and the pathetic kind of
mouth i ve only been
three months and we find it
to live over here does
does your husband like your being
if you ll allow me i ll
car together when they
up the path to her little
they saw a light there her
d better leave you here
thanked him and waving a good night
quite all if they
t met on fifth avenue one
a week later she
and blushed and seemed
glad to see him that
taine s shop all afternoon
meet her husband on the ferry at
samuel told her that her husband
back to his office but about
o clock he began
and those brown eyes
fidgeted when he looked at the
he thought of the grill down stairs
conversation thereof and opposed to
picture appeared another a little
a few minutes before
thirty he dashed on
hat and rushed for the
dull eating with a
of men she hesitated why i suppose
that her husband should
taken lunch with her but
was generally so hurried at noon
told samuel all about him he was
little smaller than samuel but
book keeper and not making a lot
money but they were very
three or four years
mood for three or four weeks
through contrast he took an accentuated
was she and earnest
faintly adventurous her name was
she was sure that her husband would
late samuel took her over to
jersey on the ferry leaving
always on the tiny front porch after
had gone in and lit the
to use the security of his
him whenever the comfortable glow fell
through the front windows that
his conge yet he never suggested coming
when samuel and marjorie had reached a
in which they sometimes touched each other
arms gently just to show
they were very good friends marjorie
her husband had one of those ultrasensitive
quarrels that couples never indulge in
they care a great deal
each other it started
a cold mutton chop or a
in the gas jet and
day samuel found her in
s with dark shadows under her brown
and a terrifying pout by this time
thought he was in love with marjorie
he played up the quarrel for all
best friend and patted
hand and leaned down close
her brown curls while she
in little sobs what her
little more than her
to the ferry in a
marjorie he said gently
he left her as usual on
porch if at any time you want
gravely and put both her
in his i know she
i know you re
friend my best friend then she
into the house and he watched
the next week samuel was
a nervous turmoil some persistently rational
in common but in such
the water that one
and desire told him
he loved marjorie wanted her had
have her the quarrel
home several times disagreeably overstimulated
made her generally miserable
to talk it out for marjorie
more to samuel when a woman
but marjorie didn t realize how much
he was part of
little cosmos one night instead of
the gas samuel went
too and they sat together on
he was very happy he envied their
neglected such a possession out
his wife but when
kissed marjorie for the first
on the wings of desperate excitement quite
he considered that his thoughts were unselfishly
her in a later
he knew that she had meant
desirous next day at taine
when they met for lunch samuel dropped
pretense and made frank love
her he had no
no definite intentions except to kiss
lips again to hold her
little and pathetic and lovable
took her home and this
high words and phrases
on his lips and then suddenly
were steps on the
dead white wait she whispered to
in a frightened voice
threw it open every one
seen such scenes on the
felt that he was playing
part and the lines came quite
he announced that all had
right to lead their own
and looked at marjorie s husband menacingly
the home forgetting that it
continued along the line of
right to happiness marjorie s
mentioned firearms and the divorce court then
in pitiful collapse on
sofa samuel haranguing the furniture
marjorie he said in
down rose again and moved hesitatingly
to get some message from her
then he shut his
plainly that he was
but he felt no
each other a few feet apart and
husband cleared his throat as though
were a bit husky that s my
he said quietly and
a wild anger surged up inside him
you he cried and
samuel in the face with
his strength in that
it flashed to him that he had
hit like that twice before and
dream he felt suddenly awake mechanically he
man was waiting fists up
yard away but samuel
that though physically he had him by
inches and many pounds
wouldn t hit him the
moment before samuel had seemed to himself
outsider and marjorie s husband
little house the eternal heroic
the defender of his
the path for the last time iv
course after the third
samuel put in several weeks at
introspection the blow years before
workman of his college days had jarred
snobbishness out of his system and
s husband had given a severe jolt
his greedy selfishness it
future wife for the only
of woman worth while seemed to
the one who could be protected as
de ferriac causing any very
blows on her own account his
he was associated with old peter carhart
s physique was like a rough
for a statue of hercules and his
was just as solid
pile made for the pure joy of
without cheap extortion or shady
he had been a great
of samuel s father but
years before taking him into his
office heaven knows how many
banks whole cities samuel was very close
carhart sent for samuel
offered him a chair and
he asked why yes i ve
work outside the office for
the adiron carhart waved this
always pulled the strings
here no admitted samuel i
to give you an outside
that whatever it was he would
it that was his employer
as dumb under direct orders as infantry
antonio and see hamil
carhart he s got
job on hand and he wants
man to take charge hamil was in
of the carhart interests in the
a man who had
up in the shadow of his employer
with whom though they
when do i leave you
i ll expect your report here on
chicago and two days later
was facing hamil across a table
the office of the merchants trust in
antonio it didn t take
to get the gist of the
it was a big deal
oil which concerned the buying up of
huge adjoining ranches this
up had to be done in one
and it was a pure
was simply to handle the matter from
tact and efficiency the right man
friction for it was
hamil with an astuteness
times valuable to his chief
arranged a situation that would give
two weeks and left for san felipe
mexico it occurred to him of course
s report on his
without that he would
done his best to put the
york hadn t made
sentimental and he was quite
to finish everything he
went well at first there was
the seventeen ranchers concerned knew samuel
business knew what he had behind him
that they had as little chance
window pane some of them were resigned
of them cared like the devil but
loophole five of the ranches
event samuel soon saw that the
man of perhaps fifty
haired clean shaven bronzed by forty
mexico summers and with those clear
eye that texas and new
weather are apt to give his ranch
not as yet shown
one had rather looked
him at first to avert the big
and he had hunted
over the territory for the
knew it he avoided samuel assiduously
samuel was sure that
the day came for the signatures
may day with hot wave
off the parched land
far as eyes could see and as
sat stewing in his little improvised
a few chairs a bench and a
table he was glad the thing
almost over he wanted
get back east the worst
and join his wife and children for
week at the seashore
meeting was set for four
clock and he was rather surprised
three thirty when the
opened and mcintyre came in
attitude and feeling a bit sorry
him mcintyre seemed closely
to the prairies and samuel
in the open afternoon said mcintyre standing
the open doorway with his feet
hello mr mcintyre samuel rose but omitted
formality of offering his hand
imagined the rancher cordially loathed
in and sat down leisurely
got us he said suddenly this
t seem to require any answer
i heard carhart was back of this
continued i gave up mr
is began samuel but mcintyre
him silent don t talk about the
sneak thief mr mcintyre said
be devoted to that sort
you can t abuse
man who d do a thing
just are skunks like
too big to handle you re being
to the door and
out across the land
sunny steaming pasturage that began
at his feet and ended with
gray green of the distant
when he turned around his mouth
trembling do you fellows love
street he said hoarsely
scheming he paused i suppose
the place he s worked
he s sweated out the best he
blue handkerchief and continued i reckon
rotten old devil had to have
just a few of the poor
couple more carriages or something
a house out there when i was
with these two hands i
a wife there at twenty one added
i started out forty summers i
over those mountains and drop
red as blood in the evening
there and he died
of an afternoon like this
the wife and i
there alone like we d lived
and sort of tried to have a
after all not a
home but nigh it cause the boy
seemed around close somehow
to see him runnin up
he could hardly speak and he turned
to the door his gray eyes contracted
s my land out
he said stretching out
it s all i
in the world and ever wanted
dashed his sleeve across his
and his tone changed as he
slowly and faced samuel but
to go samuel had to talk
out two or three of you at
price but most of you did
things never had he felt so
and it was with
a few hundred yards away but at
words the grief in mcintyre
and your dirty gang of crooks be
not one of you
god s earth you re a herd
money swine samuel rose and mcintyre
a step toward him you long winded
you got our land
that for peter carhart he swung
the shoulder quick as lightning and
went samuel in a heap dimly
heard steps in the doorway
need the rancher had sunk
in his chair and dropped
head in his hands samuel s brain
whirring he realized that the fourth
great flood of emotion
out that the law that had inexorably
in a half daze he
room the next ten minutes
perhaps the hardest of his
convictions but in actual life a man
make a rigid corpse seem a
indulgence of his own righteousness samuel
wavered that jolt had brought him
there were a log of worried faces
to convince me that in this
you are absolutely right
the peter carhart interests absolutely wrong as
as i am concerned
a half hour he had
two telegrams that staggered
was to hamil in san
in new york samuel
knew that for the first time in
business career he had made
could have acted otherwise
morning two telegrams were
it contained three words
york deal off come to new york
violently defended his scheme he was
to new york and spent
in peter carhart s office
in august samuel meredith at
five years old was
all intents made carhart s partner the
i suppose that there s
caddish streak in every man that
crosswise across his character and
secret and we never
it s there until
strike us in the dark one night
that because every time
in a sickly feeble condition
was the same devil
s friends off the bed
s house if you
meredith s jaw you d feel
lump he admits he s never
sure which fist left
there but he wouldn t lose it
anything he says there s no
like an old cad and
sometimes just before making a decision
s a great help to stroke
s so he can feel
sanity of those four fists

that lay on a
night late in november before the first
has business the dover road lay as
him beyond the dover mail
rest of the passengers did not because
had the least relish
all so heavy that the horses had

of taking it back to blackheath reins
article of war which forbade
purpose otherwise strongly in favour of
duty with drooping heads and
tails they mashed their way through
thick mud floundering and stumbling between
pieces at the larger joints as
ho then the near leader
like an unusually emphatic horse denying that
coach could be got
nervous passenger might and
disturbed in mind there was a steaming
in all the hollows and
the hill like an evil
seeking rest and finding
a clammy and intensely cold mist it
its slow way through the
one another as the waves of
unwholesome sea might do it was dense
of the coach lamps but these

eyes of the mind

ranging from the landlord to the lowest
thing upon the cards
the guard of the dover mail thought
himself that friday night in november
thousand seven hundred and seventy five lumbering
shooter s hill as he stood on
own particular perch behind the mail beating
feet and keeping an eye and
hand on the arm chest before
where a loaded blunderbuss lay
the top of six or eight loaded
pistols deposited on a substratum
one another and the guard they
suspected everybody else and
coachman was sure of nothing but the
with a clear conscience have
that they were not fit for the
so then one more pull
you re at the top and
have had trouble enough to get you

to another to walk on
little ahead into the mist

in a fair way of
the last burst carried the mail to
summit of the hill the
the wheel for the descent and
tst joe cried the
in a warning voice looking
from his box what do you say
they both listened i say a horse
a canter coming up joe i

tom returned the guard
his hold of the
of you with this
adjuration he cocked his
and stood on the offensive the
booked by this history was
the coach step getting in the
other passengers were close behind
the step half in the coach
road below him they all
from the coachman to the guard and
the guard to the coachman
listened the coachman looked
and the guard looked back
even the emphatic leader pricked up
cessation of the rumbling
motion to the coach as
it were in a state
agitation the hearts of the passengers beat
enough perhaps to be heard but
of people out of
and holding the breath and having the
quickened by expectation the sound
came fast and furiously up
loud as he could
with much splashing and
you mind what it is
the dover mail why do you
to know i want

passenger showed in a moment

mist because if i should
a mistake it could never be set

down into the road assisted

two passengers who immediately scrambled into the
shut the door and pulled up the

sure of that said the
in gruff soliloquy hallo you

of a horse and rider came slowly
the eddying mist and came
the side of the mail where
casting up his eyes at

mist closing round it
it began the descent the guard soon
his blunderbuss in his arm chest and
looked to a smaller
beneath his seat in which there
a few smith s tools

tinder box for he was furnished with
completeness that if the coach

night shadows a wonderful
to reflect upon that
human creature is constituted to be that
secret and mystery to
great city by night
every one of those darkly
houses encloses its own secret that every
in every one of them encloses
hundreds of thousands of breasts there is
some of its imaginings a
to this no more can
i loved and vainly hope in time
read it all no more can
it i have had glimpses of buried
the book should shut with
spring for ever and for
when i had read but a page
was appointed that the water
be locked in an eternal frost when
love the darling of
soul is dead it is the inexorable
was always in that individuality and which
the burial places of this city
which i pass is there a sleeper
innermost personality to me or than
am to them as to this
natural and not to be alienated
the messenger on horseback had exactly the
possessions as the king the
minister of state or the
three passengers shut up in the
compass of one lumbering old mail coach
were mysteries to one another as
as if each had
in his own coach and six
of a county between
and the next the
had eyes that assorted
well with that decoration
of a surface black with
they were afraid of being
out in something singly
they kept too far apart
had a sinister expression
an old cocked hat like
three cornered spittoon and over a
muffler for the chin and
which descended nearly to the wearer
hand only while he
his liquor in with his right
messenger harping on one theme as he
jerry you honest tradesman it
t suit your line
business recalled bust me if i don
think he d been a
his message perplexed his mind to
take off his hat to scratch
head except on the crown which was
bald he had stiff black
standing jaggedly all over
to his broad blunt nose it was
like smith s work so much
like the top of a
of hair that the best of

dangerous man in the

the mare as arose out
her private topics of uneasiness they seemed
coach lumbered jolted rattled and
upon its tedious way with its
the shadows of the night
themselves in the forms their
eyes and wandering thoughts suggested tellson s
had a run upon it in
mail as the bank passenger with an
drawn through the leathern strap which did
lay in it to keep
from pounding against the next
and driving him into
half shut eyes the little coach windows
the coach lamp dimly gleaming
of opposite passenger became
the rattle of the harness
the chink of money and
than even tellson s with all
foreign and home connection ever
strong rooms underground at tellson
he went in among them
candle and found them safe
he had last seen them
though the bank was almost always with
of pain under an opiate was
with him there was another
of impression that never
was on his way to dig some
out of a grave now
themselves before him was the true
of the buried person
differed principally in the
they expressed and in the
of their worn and
state pride contempt defiance stubbornness submission
succeeded one another so did varieties of
main one face and every
was prematurely white a hundred times
dozing passenger inquired of

years you had abandoned
see her the answers to this
broken reply was wait
soon sometimes it was
in a tender rain of tears and
after such imaginary discourse the

great key now with his hands to

lamps and the hedge

rooms the real express sent after him
the real message returned

and he would accost it again buried
care to live i can
say dig dig dig until an impatient
from one of the
passengers would admonish him
pull up the window
his arm securely through
leathern strap and speculate upon
two slumbering forms until his mind
its hold of them
they again slid away into the bank
you had abandoned all hope
being dug out long
his hearing as just spoken
in his hearing as ever spoken words
been in his life when the weary
started to the consciousness
daylight and found that the
of the night were gone he lowered
window and looked out at the rising
there was a ridge of ploughed
it had been left last night
quiet coppice wood in
many leaves of burning red and
yellow still remained upon the
though the earth was cold and
the sun rose bright
gracious creator of day to be buried
for eighteen years iv
preparation when the mail got successfully to
head drawer at the royal george hotel
the coach door as his
flourish of ceremony for a mail journey
upon by that time there was
one adventurous traveller left be
for the two others had
set down at their respective roadside destinations
with its damp and dirty straw
like a larger dog kennel mr lorry
passenger shaking himself out of
in chains of straw a tangle
legs was rather like
larger sort of dog there will

tolerable fair the tide will serve
nicely at about two in the afternoon
i want a bedroom and a
show concord gentleman s valise and
water to concord pull

sea coal fire sir
concord the concord bed chamber being always
passengers by the mail
always heavily wrapped up from head
one kind of man was seen to
varieties of men came out of it
several maids and the landlady
but very well kept
large square cuffs and
occupant that forenoon than the gentleman
brown his breakfast table was drawn
the fire and as he sat
its light shining on him
for the meal he sat
still that he might have been
for his portrait very orderly and
and a loud watch ticking a
it pitted its gravity and
brisk fire he had a good
setting very close to his head
as though it were spun
filaments of silk or glass
linen though not of a fineness in
tops of the waves that
suppressed and quieted was
lighted up under the quaint
by a pair of
bright eyes that it
have cost their owner
the composed and reserved
of tellson s bank he had a
colour in his cheeks
his face though lined bore few traces
cares of other people and
to a man who was sitting for
the arrival of his breakfast roused
and he said to
drawer as he moved
ask for mr jarvis lorry
she may only ask for a
from tellson s bank please
tellson s bank in london sir
honour to entertain your

betwixt london and paris sir a vast
s house yes we are
a french house as well

since i came last from france indeed
that was before my time
sir before our people s time here
the george was in other hands
that time sir i believe so but
company was flourishing a matter of
ago you might treble
and say a hundred and fifty yet
stood surveying the guest while he ate
drank as from an observatory or watchtower
for a stroll on the beach
itself away from the
cliffs like a marine ostrich the beach
a desert of heaps of sea and
that one might have
sick fish went up to
sea a little fishing
of strolling about by night and looking
tide made and was near flood
unaccountably realised large fortunes and it was
that nobody in the neighbourhood could endure
afternoon and the air which had
coast to be seen became
lorry s thoughts seemed to cloud
he sat before the
he had awaited his breakfast his mind
busily digging digging digging in the
red coals a bottle
good claret after dinner does a digger

time and had just poured
his last glassful of wine with
to be found in an
when a rattling of wheels came up
narrow street and rumbled into the
yard he set down his
he in a very
to announce that miss manette
arrived from london and would
happy to see the
from tellson s so soon
manette had taken some refreshment
the road and required
then and was extremely anxious
the gentleman from tellson
had nothing left for it but
air of stolid desperation
his odd little flaxen wig
the ears and follow
waiter to miss manette s
leaf as if they were buried in
from them until they were
out the obscurity was so difficult
penetrate that mr lorry picking his
carpet supposed miss manette to be
the moment in some adjacent
he saw standing to receive him
the table between them and
fire a young lady of
its ribbon in her hand
forehead with a singular capacity remembering how
and smooth it was of rifting
wonder or alarm or
though it included all the four expressions
his eyes rested on these
a sudden vivid likeness
before him of a child whom
time when the hail drifted heavily and
a breath along the surface of the
pier glass behind her
the frame of which
headless and all cripples
offering black baskets of dead
manette pray take a seat
in a very clear and pleasant
voice a little foreign in its
but a very little
i kiss your hand miss said
his formal bow again and took his
bank sir yesterday informing me that some
or discovery the word is
small property of my poor

they had any help for

paris there to communicate with a
of the bank so good as
as i was prepared to
those days with a pretty
to convey to him that she felt
she he made her another bow
replied to the bank sir that
it was considered necessary by
who know and who are so kind
to advise me that i should go
france and that as i am an
and have no friend who
go with me i should esteem
to place myself during the journey

after him to beg the favour

happy to execute it sir i thank

that the gentleman would explain to me

she caught at or stayed some

and fine as it was possible to

lady miss manette if you

in the street the
out with a run the
had burst and it lay
the stones just outside the
walnut shell all the people within reach
drink the wine the rough irregular
of the street pointing every way and
it into little pools
were surrounded each by its own
group or crowd according
its size some men
shoulders to sip before the wine
handkerchiefs from women s heads which were
dry into infants mouths others made small
embankments to stem the wine as
ran others directed by lookers on up
off little streams of wine that
and lee dyed pieces of the cask
wine rotted fragments with eager relish
was no drainage to carry off
wine and not only
it all get taken up
so much mud got taken
might have been a scavenger in the
if anybody acquainted with it could have
sound of laughter and of
voices voices of men women
while this wine game lasted
one to join some other
hearted to frolicsome embraces drinking of healths
of hands and even joining
hands and dancing a

most abundant were raked into a gridiron
by fingers these demonstrations ceased as
as they had broken out

matted locks and cadaverous faces who

and had stained the ground
the narrow street in
it was spilled it
stained many hands too and many
and many naked feet and
wooden shoes the hands of the man
sawed the wood left red marks
the stain of the old rag
the cask had acquired a tigerish smear

joker so besmirched his head
out of a long squalid bag

preparation that was offered for
hunger rattled its dry bones
its abiding place was in all

a brooding look upon them

the wine shop had stood
it in a yellow waistcoat

final shrug of the shoulders the people
tall joker writing up his joke he
to him across the way say then
gaspard what do you do there the
pointed to his joke with immense

keeper crossing the road and
the jest with a
of mud picked up
the purpose and smeared over it

joker rapped it with his own
a nimble spring upward and came down
stained shoes jerked off his foot
of an extremely not to

advice he wiped his
hand upon the joker s dress
as it was quite deliberately as having
the hand on his
and then recrossed the
and entered the wine shop this
shop keeper was a bull necked
looking man of thirty and
should have been of a
day he wore no
but carried one slung over his shoulder
did he wear anything more on
head than his own crisply curling short
hair he was a dark man altogether
good eyes and a good
on the whole but
a strong resolution and a set
a man not desirable to
met rushing down a
pass with a gulf on either
his wife sat in the shop
about his own age
look at anything a large hand heavily
great composure of manner there was
character about madame defarge from which
not often make mistakes against
in any of the reckonings over
she presided madame defarge being sensitive
and had a quantity of bright
to the concealment of her
engaged with her right elbow supported by
left hand madame defarge said nothing when
grain of cough this
combination with the lifting of her
defined eyebrows over her
by the breadth of a line suggested
well to look round the shop
the customers for any new customer
had dropped in while he stepped over
rolled his eyes about until
rested upon an elderly
and a young lady who were
playing cards two playing
three standing by the
as he passed behind the counter
a look to the young lady this
our man what the
do you do in that
there said monsieur defarge to himself i
feigned not to notice
the triumvirate of customers who were drinking
the counter how goes it jacques said
of these three to
defarge is all the spilt wine
every drop jacques answered monsieur defarge when
interchange of christian name was effected madame
picking her teeth with
and raised her eyebrows
the breadth of another line
defarge that many of these
beasts know the taste
bread and death is
not so jacques it is so
monsieur defarge returned at
defarge still using her toothpick with
by the breadth of another line
last of the three now
his empty drinking vessel and smacked his
ah so much the
a bitter taste it is that
poor cattle always have in
you are right jacques was
moment when madame defarge
eyebrows up and slightly rustled in her
flourishes she acknowledged their homage by
a quick look then she glanced in
casual manner round the wine shop
calmness and repose of
and became absorbed in it gentlemen said
husband who had kept his bright
observantly upon her good day
chamber furnished bachelor fashion
you wished to see and were
for when i stepped
the left here pointing with his
near to the window
and can show the way
wine and left the place
at her knitting when
elderly gentleman advanced from his
and begged the favour
a word willingly sir said monsieur
the door their conference
very short but very
and went out the gentleman
beckoned to the young
and they too went
madame defarge knitted with nimble
and steady eyebrows and saw nothing
had directed his own company just
it opened from a stinking little black
great pile of houses
by a great number of people in
paved staircase monsieur defarge bent down on
knee to the child
his old master and put her
to his lips it was a
action but not at all gently done
very remarkable transformation had come over
in a few seconds he had
good humour in his face
become a secret angry dangerous
it is very high it is
little difficult better to begin
thus monsieur defarge in
they began ascending the stairs is he
him who should be with him
the other in the
low voice is he
alone then yes of his
desire of his own necessity as he
when i first saw him after
found me and demanded to know if
my peril be discreet as
was then so he is now
is greatly changed changed the
of the wine shop stopped
strike the wall with
hand and mutter a tremendous curse
direct answer could have been half
forcible mr lorry s spirits
two companions ascended higher
its accessories in the older and
crowded parts of paris would be
was vile indeed to unaccustomed
that is to say the room
own heap of refuse on
its own windows the
and hopeless mass of decomposition so engendered
have polluted the air even if poverty
deprivation had not loaded it
their intangible impurities the two bad
atmosphere by a steep dark shaft of
and poison the way lay
to his own disturbance of mind
to his young companion s agitation
a doleful grating by which any languishing
airs that were left uncorrupted seemed to
to crawl in through the
caught of the jumbled neighbourhood
nothing within range nearer
lower than the summits
the two great towers of
at last the top of the
was gained and they stopped for
of contracted dimensions to
ascended before the garret story was reached
himself about here and carefully feeling
carried over his shoulder
out a key the
is locked then my friend
mr lorry surprised ay
was the grim reply of monsieur
you think it necessary to keep the
necessary to turn the key
frowned heavily why why because he
he would be frightened rave tear
door was left open
possible repeated defarge bitterly yes
it is possible and when many other
but done done see you
that sky there every
on this dialogue had been held
that not a word of it
reached the young lady
ears but by this time
all such dread and
to speak a word or two of
courage dear miss courage business the worst
be over in a moment it is
over then all the
to him begin let our good
here assist you on that side that
an abrupt turn in it
came all at once in sight of
men whose heads were bent down close
into the room to which the
belonged through some chinks or holes
the wall on hearing
close at hand these three turned and
and showed themselves to be the
been drinking in the wine shop
your visit explained monsieur
leave us good boys we have business
silently down there appearing to be no
door on that floor
the keeper of the
they were left alone mr
asked him in a whisper
a little anger do
make a show of monsieur manette
show him in the way you
seen to a chosen few is that
them i choose them as real men
my name jacques is my name to
the sight is likely to do good
moment with an admonitory gesture to
soon raising his head again he struck
or thrice upon the
evidently with no other
than to make a
under his hand and he looked into
room and said something a faint
answered something little more than a
syllable could have been
shoulder and beckoned them
enter mr lorry got
arm securely round the daughter s
was sinking a a
on his cheek come in come in
am afraid of it she
shuddering of it what i mean
desperate by her state and by
beckoning of their conductor he
over his neck the arm
into the room he sat her down
to him defarge drew out the
closed the door locked it on
and held it in
hand all this he did
and with as loud and
an accompaniment of noise as he could
a measured tread to where the
was he stopped there and
round the garret built to be
dim and dark for the window
a door in the roof with
hoisting up of stores from the
unglazed and closing up the middle in
pieces like any other door
french construction to exclude the
but a very little way such a
portion of light was admitted through
means that it was
on first coming in to
anything and long habit alone could have
formed in any one the ability
do any work requiring
that kind was being done
the garret for with his back towards
door and his face towards
white haired man sat on a
bench stooping forward and very busy
head that bent low
the shoemaking it was raised for a
and a very faint voice responded to
salutation as if it were at a
i see after a long silence the
was lifted for another
and the voice replied yes i am
this time a pair of
eyes had looked at the questioner
the face had dropped again the
fare no doubt had their part
it its deplorable peculiarity was
it was the faintness of solitude and
it was like the last
echo of a sound made
and long ago so
had it lost the life and resonance
the human voice that it affected the
a poor weak stain so sunken
suppressed it was that
was like a voice
so expressive it was of a
and lost creature that a
traveller wearied out by
home and friends in
a tone before lying down to
some minutes of silent work
passed and the haggard
or curiosity but with a dull mechanical
stood was not yet empty i want
you can bear a little more
shoemaker stopped his work looked with a
air of listening at the floor on
at the speaker what did
a stress upon the
a little further and secured at that
for the time a broad
of light fell into the
labour his few common tools and various
of leather were at
feet and on his bench he
exceedingly bright eyes the hollowness and thinness
his face would have caused
to look large under his yet
had been really otherwise but they
his yellow rags of shirt lay
his body to be withered and worn
and his old canvas frock and
loose stockings and all his poor
direct light and air faded
parchment yellow that it would have been
to say which was which
very bones of it seemed transparent
he sat with a
looked at the figure
of himself then on that
if he had lost the
of associating place with sound he never
and forgetting to speak are you going
to come forward what did you say
you mean to finish
the question reminded him
his work and he bent over
again mr lorry came
forward leaving the daughter
a minute or two by
side of defarge the shoemaker
one of his hands strayed to his
as he looked at it
lips and his nails were
the same pale lead colour and then
more bent over the shoe the
and the action had occupied
did you say here is a
before but without removing a hand
that shoe you are working at take
of shoe it is and the maker
name there was a longer pause
what it was you asked
what did you say i
couldn t you describe the kind of
for monsieur s information
is a lady s shoe it
a young lady s walking shoe
is in the present mode
never saw the mode i
had a pattern in
hand he glanced at the
with some little passing
of pride and the maker
name said defarge now that
had no work to
in the hollow of the
and then the knuckles of the left
passed a hand across his bearded
and so on in regular
without a moment s
person from a swoon or endeavouring in
stay the spirit of a fast
man did you ask me
five north tower is that
one hundred and five north tower with
weary sound that was not
sigh nor a groan he
shoemaker by trade said mr
looking steadfastly at him his haggard
have transferred the question to
but as no help came
when they had sought the ground
was not a shoemaker by trade
myself i asked leave to he lapsed
even for minutes ringing
measured changes on his
the whole time his eyes came slowly
at last to the
from which they had wandered
they rested on it he
that moment awake reverting
it with much difficulty after a
while and i have made shoes ever
as he held out his hand
the shoe that had been taken
him mr lorry said still looking
in his face monsieur
looking fixedly at the questioner
nothing of this man look at him
at me is there no old
no old business no old servant
as the captive of many years
at defarge some long
marks of an actively intent
in the middle of the
him they were overclouded again they
fainter they were gone but they
to a point where she
first had been only
in frightened compassion if
even to keep him
and shut out the sight
him but which were now
the spectral face upon her
young breast and love it
to life and hope so exactly was
looked as though it had
darkness had fallen on him in
place he looked at the two less
less attentively and his eyes in gloomy
took the shoe up
resumed his work have you
first i thought it quite hopeless but
have unquestionably seen for
single moment the face that i once
further back hush she
moved from the wall
bench on which he
there was something awful in his
of the figure that could
as he stooped over his labour
a word was spoken not
sound was made she stood like
spirit beside him and he bent
his work it happened at length that
had occasion to change the instrument
his hand for his shoemaker s knife
was not the side
which she stood he had taken it
his eyes caught the skirt of
dress he raised them and saw
forward but she stayed them with a
no fear of his striking
stared at her with a fearful
and after a while his lips began
form some words though no sound
his quick and laboured
he was heard to say what is
her face she put her two
to her lips and kissed them
her breast as if
she sighed no who
of her voice she
down on the bench beside him he
his frame he laid
knife down softly as
hurriedly pushed aside and fell
over her neck advancing his hand
little and little he took it
and looked at it
the midst of the action he went
fell to work at
his arm she laid her hand
if to be sure that
was really there he laid down
took off a blackened
rag attached to it he
this carefully on his knee
it contained a very
quantity of hair not
golden hairs which he had in
old day wound off
can it be when was it how
it as the concentrated expression
to his forehead he seemed to become
her full to the light and
at her she had
i was summoned out she had a
of my going though i had
help me to escape in the body
they may in the spirit
were the words i said i remember
very well he formed this speech with
lips many times before he could
it but when he did find spoken
him coherently though slowly how was this
it you once more
two spectators started as he turned upon
perfectly still in his grasp
voice i entreat you good
do not come near us do not
do not move hark
hands released her as
his white hair which
tore in a frenzy it
out as everything but his shoemaking did
out of him and he refolded his
breast but he still looked at
and gloomily shook his head
no no you are too
too blooming it can t be see
voice she ever heard no no she
and he was before
slow years of the
tower ages ago what is your
my gentle angel hailing his softened
upon her knees before him with
shall know my name and
my mother was and who
at this time and i
tell you here all that i
i pray to you to touch
and to bless me kiss
kiss me o my dear my dear
though it were the light of
shining on him if
t know that it is so
i hope it is if
hear in my voice any resemblance to
voice that once was sweet music
your ears weep for it weep for
if you touch in
my hair anything that recalls a beloved
that lay on your
when you were young and free
if when i hint
is before us where
will be true to you with all
and rocked him on her breast
a child if when i
you dearest dear that
we go to england to
laid waste and of our native france
for it and if
i shall tell you of my
learn that i have
kneel to my honoured
his torture from me weep for it
for it weep for her then and
his sacred tears upon my
thank god he had sunk
breast a sight so
yet so terrible in the tremendous wrong
that the two beholders covered their faces
the quiet of the garret had
shaken form had long yielded to
calm that must follow all storms
which the storm called life must
at last they came forward to
the father and daughter from the ground
had gradually dropped to the
worn out she had nestled down with
that his head might
him curtained him from the light
hand to mr lorry as
stooped over them after
blowings of his nose all could be
for our leaving paris at once so
consider is he fit for the
asked mr lorry more
for that i think
him it is true said
and hear more than that monsieur manette
for all reasons best out of france
shall i hire a carriage and
horses that s business
mr lorry resuming on the shortest notice
methodical manners and if business
to be done i had better do
miss manette as to
us here you see how composed
has become and you cannot
should you be if you will lock
door to secure us from interruption i
not doubt that you
find him when you come
as quiet as you
him in any case i
straight both mr lorry
course and in favour
as there were not only
travelling papers and as time pressed
an end it came
last to their hastily dividing the
that was necessary to be
and hurrying away to do
father s side and watched him
they both lay quiet until
light gleamed through the
in the wall mr
and monsieur defarge had
brought with them besides travelling
and wrappers bread and meat
and hot coffee monsieur defarge put this
and the lamp he carried on
in the garret but a pallet bed
he and mr lorry roused the captive
assisted him to his feet no human
could have read the
knew what had happened whether he
what they had said to him whether
no sagacity could have solved
so confused and so
slow to answer that they took
at his bewilderment and agreed
the time to tamper with him no
he had a wild lost manner of
clasping his head in his
that had not been
in the mere sound of his daughter
she spoke in the submissive way
one long accustomed to obey under coercion
gave him to eat
and other wrappings that they gave him
wear he readily responded to his
s drawing her arm through his
took and kept her hand
both his own they began to
of the long main staircase
he stopped and stared at the
and round at the wails
remember the place my father you
coming up here what did
say but before she
repeat the question he murmured an answer
if she had repeated
so very long ago that he
north tower and when
which had long encompassed him on
reaching the courtyard he instinctively altered his
as being in expectation
a drawbridge and when there
no drawbridge and he saw the
waiting in the open street he dropped
daughter s hand and
even a chance passerby was in
street an unnatural silence and
was to be seen and that was
defarge who leaned against
door post knitting and saw nothing
prisoner had got into
coach and his daughter had followed him
mr lorry s feet
arrested on the step by his
miserably for his shoemaking
and the unfinished shoes madame defarge immediately
to her husband that
knitting out of the lamplight
the courtyard she quickly brought them
and handed them in and immediately afterwards
the box and gave the word to
barrier the postilion cracked his whip
they clattered away under the

gay crowds illuminated coffee houses and
doors to one of the
gates soldiers with lanterns at the

in the year one
was very small very dark very ugly
incommodious it was an old
place moreover in the
attribute that the partners in the house
proud of its smallness proud of its
incommodiousness they were even boastful
and were fired by an express
that if it were less objectionable
passive belief but an active weapon which
no elbow room tellson s wanted

jerry not unlike a reluctant
i as a honest tradesman wish

interchange the inquiry what do you think

hard to spile him sir
at all retained the ancient
good friend and leave the law

voice said jerry i leave
to judge what a damp way
all have our various ways of
a livelihood some of us
jerry took the letter and
to himself with less internal deference
he made an outward show of you
and villainy were practised and where dire
happened that the judge in
black cap pronounced his own doom as
as the prisoner s and even
kind of deadly inn
carts and coaches on
violent passage into the
world traversing some two
and shaming few good
and so desirable to be
use in the beginning it
inflicted a punishment of which no
could foresee the extent also for the
very humanising and softening
of ancestral wisdom systematically
to the most frightful
crimes that could be committed
heaven altogether the old bailey
that date was a choice illustration of
it is lazy did it
that ever was was
hideous scene of action with
way quietly the messenger found out
door he sought and handed in
to see the play at
see the play in
therefore all the old bailey doors
doors by which the criminals got there
those were always left wide open after
delay and demur the door grudgingly turned
its hinges a very little way and
of the man he found
next to nothing yet what s coming
ah returned the man with a relish
be half hanged and then he
own face and then his inside
be taken out and burnt while
looks on and then his head
be chopped off and he ll be
into quarters that s
sentence if he s
guilty you mean to say jerry added
mr cruncher s attention was here
to the door keeper whom he
making his way to mr lorry
lorry sat at a
among the gentlemen in wigs not far
who had a great
of papers before him
nearly opposite another wigged
with his hands in
pockets whose whole attention when mr cruncher
at him then or
signing with his hand jerry attracted
stood up to look for him and
again what s he got to
with the case asked
man he had spoken
blest if i know
do with it then
the entrance of the judge
in the court stopped the dialogue
the dock became the central point of
standing there went out and the
wigged gentleman who looked at the
stared at him all
human breath in the place
at him like a
faces strained round pillars and corners
get a sight of
up not to miss
of the court laid their hands
the shoulders of the people before
got upon ledges stood upon next to
conspicuous among these latter like
animated bit of the spiked wall
newgate jerry stood aiming at the prisoner
it to mingle with the
of other beer and
and tea and coffee
what not that flowed at
and already broke upon the great windows
and rain the object
all this staring and blaring was a
man of about five and
hair which was long
as an emotion of the
will express itself through any covering of
body so the paleness
his situation engendered came through
brown upon his cheek showing the
to be stronger than the sun
was otherwise quite self possessed bowed to
judge and stood quiet the
of interest with which
that elevated humanity had he
had there been a chance
any one of its savage details
butchered and torn asunder
the sensation whatever gloss the various spectators
and powers of self deceit
had yesterday pleaded not guilty
an indictment denouncing him
infinite jingle and jangle for
he was a false
to our serene illustrious excellent
so forth prince our lord the king
reason of his having on
occasions and by divers means and
assisted lewis the french
in his wars against our
serene illustrious excellent and
coming and going between the
of our said serene illustrious
and wickedly falsely traitorously and otherwise
lewis what forces our said serene illustrious
america this much jerry with his
becoming more and more
as the law terms bristled it made
with huge satisfaction and so
his trial that the
attorney general was making ready to speak
being mentally hanged beheaded
quartered by everybody there
flinched from the situation nor assumed
proceedings with a grave interest and
with his hands resting
the slab of wood before him
a leaf of the
with which it was
the court was all
as a precaution against gaol air
gaol fever over the prisoner s head
light down upon him crowds
the wicked and the wretched
been reflected in it
had passed from its
a most ghastly manner that abominable place
have been if the glass could ever
to give up its dead
passing thought of the infamy and
for which it had
reserved may have struck the prisoner s
conscious of a bar of light
he saw the glass his face flushed
his right hand pushed the
left about on a level
s bench two persons upon whom
look immediately rested so immediately and
much to the changing
his aspect that all the
the spectators saw in the two
evidently her father a man of a
remarkable appearance in respect
certain indescribable intensity of face not
an active kind but pondering and self
when this expression was upon
as it was now in a
on his speaking to his daughter
became a handsome man not past
prime of life his daughter
one of her hands drawn through his
the other pressed upon it
had drawn close to him in her
had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing
noticeable so very powerfully and naturally shown
starers who had had
by her and the whisper went
who are they jerry
messenger who had made his own
in his own manner and
had been sucking the rust
to hear who they were the crowd
to the nearest attendant and
him it had been more slowly pressed
against against what side the prisoner s
judge whose eyes had
in the general direction
steadily at the man
grind the axe and
the nails into the scaffold
a disappointment mr attorney general
to inform the jury that the
before them though young in years
old in the treasonable practices
correspondence with the public enemy was not
correspondence of to day or
yesterday or even of
was certain the prisoner had
of passing and repassing
which he could give no honest account
if it were in the
real wickedness and guilt
providence however had put it into
heart of a person who was
fear and beyond reproach to
out the nature of the prisoner s
and struck with horror to disclose them
and most honourable privy council that
patriot would be produced
the prisoner s friend but at once
an auspicious and an evil hour
his infamy had resolved
immolate the traitor he
as in ancient greece
shining citizen would assuredly have had
that as they were not
decreed he probably would not
one that virtue as
been observed by the poets in
passages which he well knew the jury
whereat the jury s countenances displayed a
more especially the bright virtue
as patriotism or love of
that the lofty example of this
and unimpeachable witness for the crown
determination to examine his master s table
papers that he mr attorney general was
to hear some disparagement attempted
him to his mr attorney general s
and sisters and honoured him more
that he called with
that the evidence of these two
coupled with the documents of their
show the prisoner to
been furnished with lists
their disposition and preparation both
no doubt that he had
conveyed such information to a hostile power
these lists could not be proved to
in the prisoner s handwriting but that
indeed it was rather the better
the prosecution as showing the
to be artful in his precautions that
in these pernicious missions within
reasons the jury being a loyal
as he knew they were and
a responsible jury as they
they liked it or
their wives laying their
never could endure the notion
their children laying their heads upon their
in short that there never more
heads upon pillows at all unless
prisoner s head was taken off
them in the name of everything
could think of with a
and gone when the attorney general
as if a cloud of great blue
were swarming about the prisoner
anticipation of what he was soon to
when toned down again
unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness
mr solicitor general then following his
s lead examined the
his pure soul was exactly what
perhaps if it had a
a little too exactly having
his noble bosom of its burden he
the wigged gentleman with the papers before
ask him a few
the wigged gentleman sitting opposite still
at the ceiling of the court
he ever been a spy himself no
scorned the base insinuation what did he
upon his property where was his property
anybody s had he inherited it yes
had from whom distant relation very distant
see what that had to
with it never in
how many times two or
of what profession gentleman ever been
decidedly not once received a kick on
top of a staircase
on that occasion for cheating at
something to that effect
said by the intoxicated
was not true swear
live by play not more than other
do ever borrow money of
one forced upon the prisoner in
inns and packets no sure he saw
prisoner with these lists certain knew
and employment to lay traps
anything oh dear no swear that over
over again no motives but
of sheer patriotism none whatever the
the case at a
ago he had asked the prisoner aboard
calais packet if he wanted
handy fellow and the
had engaged him he had not asked
prisoner to take the handy fellow as
act of charity never
of such a thing he began
have suspicions of the prisoner
to keep an eye upon him
afterwards in arranging his
while travelling he had seen similar lists
these in the prisoner s pockets over
over again he had taken these
from the drawer of the
s desk he had
put them there first he
seen the prisoner show these
lists to french gentlemen at calais
similar lists to french
both at calais and boulogne
loved his country and couldn t
it and had given
had been maligned respecting a mustard pot
one he had known
last witness seven or eight
that was merely a
curious coincidence most coincidences
curious neither did he call it a
like him the blue flies buzzed again
mr attorney general called mr jarvis
mr jarvis lorry are you a clerk
tellson s bank i am
a certain friday night in november one
london and dover by
mail it did were there any other
of the night they did mr lorry
one of those two
does he resemble either of these two
all so reserved that
cannot undertake to say even that
lorry look again upon the prisoner
two passengers were is there anything
his bulk and stature to render it
you will not swear
lorry that he was not
of them no so
least you say he may
been one of them yes except that
remember them both to
prisoner has not a timorous air did
mr lorry i certainly have seen
seen him to your certain knowledge
from france a few
in which i returned and
the voyage with me at what hour
board at that untimely hour he
to be the only one never mind
passenger who came on board in the
of the night he was were you
here had you any conversation
the prisoner hardly any the
was stormy and the
long and rough and i
on a sofa almost
to whom all eyes had been
father rose with her and kept
hand drawn through his arm
be confronted with such pity and such
as it were apart with
on the edge of his grave not
the staring curiosity that looked on
still his hurried right
parcelled out the herbs before him into
beds of flowers in a
and his efforts to
and steady his breathing shook the
from which the colour
to his heart the
manette have you seen the
before yes sir where on
referred to sir and on the same
you are the young lady
the judge as he said something
manette had you any
with the prisoner on
recall it in the midst of a
stillness she faintly began when the
my lord then say
prisoner when the prisoner
on board he noticed
my father turning her eyes lovingly to
weak state of health
was afraid to take him
on the deck near the cabin
and i sat on the
prisoner was so good as to beg
to advise me how i could
my father from the wind and
better than i had done i had
known how to do it well not
did it for me he
great gentleness and kindness for my father
manner of our beginning
speak together let me interrupt you for
moment had he come on board alone
had they conferred together they had conferred
was necessary for the french
about among them similar to
lists some papers had
and size possibly but indeed
stood at the top of the
steps to have the light of the
that was hanging there
spoke very low and i
not hear what they said and saw
that they looked at papers now
the prisoner s conversation miss manette the
was as open in his confidence with
and useful to my father i hope
repay him by doing him
to day buzzing from the blue
miss manette if the prisoner does
perfectly understand that you give
give which you must give and
you cannot escape from giving with great
he is the only person present in
condition please to go on he told
that he was travelling on business
people into trouble and that he was
travelling under an assumed name
days taken him to
and might at intervals take him backwards
a long time to come did he
be particular he tried to explain to
he said that so far as he
a jesting way that perhaps george washington
as george the third
there was no harm in his way
and to beguile the time
strongly marked expression of face on
a scene of great
was painfully anxious and intent as
she stopped for the judge
court insomuch that a
notes to glare at that tremendous
general now signified to my
that he deemed it necessary as
matter of precaution and form
manette who was called
years and a half ago
you identify him as
fellow passenger on board the
any particular and special reason for
being unable to do either he
in a low voice there
even accusation in your native country
to every heart a
imprisonment were you newly released
what time when i employed myself
to the time when i found myself
in london with my dear daughter
but i am quite unable even to
how she had become
process mr attorney general sat down and
singular circumstance then arose in the case
object in hand being to show
fellow plotter untracked in the
mail on that friday night
november five years ago and
out of the mail in the night
a blind at a place where he
not remain but from
he travelled back some dozen miles or
to a garrison and dockyard and there
to identify him as having
at the precise time
another person the prisoner s
with no result except that
on any other occasion when the
looking at the ceiling
the court wrote a word or two
a little piece of paper
opening this piece of
witness was quite sure did you
see anybody very like the prisoner
that he could be
my learned friend there pointing to him
had tossed the paper
prisoner how say you
they very like each other allowing
slovenly if not debauched they were sufficiently
prayed to bid my learned
lay aside his wig and
no very gracious consent the likeness
much more remarkable my lord inquired
mr stryver the prisoner
treason but mr stryver
tell him whether what happened once might
his rashness sooner whether
would be so confident having seen it
vessel and shiver his
of the case to useless lumber mr
had by this time taken quite a
of rust off his fingers in his
s case on the
like a compact suit of clothes
them how the patriot barsad was a
spy and traitor an unblushing
scoundrels upon earth since accursed judas
he certainly did look
cly was his friend and partner
was worthy to be
the watchful eyes of those forgers and
as a victim because some family
extraction did require his making
passages across the channel though
him forbade him even for
the young lady whose anguish in giving
likely to pass between any
gentleman and young lady so
together with the exception of
reference to george washington
regarded in any other light
this attempt to practise
popularity on the lowest national
upon nothing save that
and infamous character of evidence too
but there my lord interposed with as
a face as if it had not
suffer those allusions mr stryver then called
to attend while mr attorney general
showing how barsad and cly
hundred times worse lastly came
but on the whole
trimming and shaping them
grave clothes for the prisoner and
the jury turned to consider and
great flies swarmed again
carton who had so long sat
court changed neither his place nor his
mr stryver massing his papers before
from time to time glanced anxiously at
jury while all the
moved more or less
arose from his seat and
paced up and down his platform not
by a suspicion in the minds
the audience that his state
his torn gown half off him
untidy wig put on just as
after its removal his hands in his
and his eyes on the ceiling
gave him a disreputable look but
undoubtedly bore to the prisoner which his
taking note of him
would hardly have thought the two were
next neighbour and added i
hold half a guinea that he don
don t look like the sort of
to get any do he
this mr carton took in
of the details of the scene than
appeared to take in for now when
breast he was the first
out don t you see
will fall there was much commiseration for
as she was removed and much sympathy
have the days of his imprisonment recalled
like a heavy cloud
since as he passed out the jury
had turned back and paused a moment
through their foreman they were not agreed
george washington on his mind
signified his pleasure that
all day and the lamps in the
were now being lighted
the jury would be out a
while the spectators dropped off to get
and the prisoner withdrew
her father went out now reappeared
interest could easily get near him jerry
you wish to take
to eat you can but
hear when the jury come in
you are the quickest messenger
know and will get
temple bar long before i can
of this communication and a shilling mr
mr lorry on the arm how is
young lady she is greatly
she feels the better for being out
court i ll tell the prisoner so
publicly you know mr
debated the point in his
and mr carton made his way
the outside of the bar
that direction and jerry followed him all
ears and spikes mr darnay the
manette she will do very
you have seen the worst of her
i am deeply sorry
have been the cause of it could
tell her so for
with my fervent acknowledgments
i could i will if you
it mr carton s manner was so
as to be almost
he stood half turned from the
lounging with his elbow
it accept my cordial thanks what said
still only half turned towards him
worst it s the wisest thing to
their withdrawing is in your
loitering on the way
of court not being allowed jerry heard
in manner standing side by side
reflected in the glass
them an hour and
assisted off with mutton
and ale the hoarse messenger uncomfortably
on a form after
doze when a loud
setting up the stairs that led
at the door when he
to get back again here i
sir mr lorry handed
a paper through the throng
word aquitted if you had
the message `recalled to
again muttered jerry as he turned i
time he had no opportunity of
or so much as thinking anything else
a vehemence that nearly took him off
legs and a loud buzz swept into
street as if the baffled
flies were dispersing in
of other carrion iv congratulatory
the dimly lighted passages of
court the last sediment
the human stew that had been
doctor manette lucie manette his
mr lorry the solicitor for the
and its counsel mr
escape from death it would have been
of face and upright
bearing the shoemaker of the garret in
yet no one could have
at him twice without looking again even
the opportunity of observation
not extended to the mournful cadence of
apparent reason while one
cause and that a reference to
on the trial evoke this condition from
depths of his soul it was
in its nature to arise of itself
to draw a gloom over
hundred miles away only his daughter
the power of charming this black brooding
his mind she was the golden
past beyond his misery and to a
the touch of her hand had
strong beneficial influence with
her power had failed but they
believed them over mr darnay had
her hand fervently and gratefully
had turned to mr
whom he warmly thanked
stryver a man of
more than thirty but looking twenty years
than he was stout loud red
and free from any drawback
delicacy had a pushing way
shouldering himself morally and physically into
and conversations that argued well for
shouldering his way up in life
and he said squaring himself
he squeezed the innocent
lorry clean out of the group
am glad to have brought
off with honour mr darnay
was an infamous prosecution grossly infamous but
that account you have
me under an obligation to you for
in two senses said his late client
his hand i have done my
for you mr darnay and
another man s i believe
clearly being incumbent on
mr lorry said it perhaps
quite disinterestedly but with
interested object of squeezing
day and you ought to know you
a man of business too and
such quoth mr lorry whom the counsel
in the law had now
back into the group just
it as such i will appeal
lucie looks ill mr
worn out speak for yourself mr lorry
to do yet speak
and for mr darnay
for miss lucie and miss lucie
you not think i may speak for
all he asked her the
pointedly and with a glance at her
his face had become frozen as it
in a very curious look at
a frown of dislike
distrust not even unmixed with fear
father said lucie softly laying her
on his he slowly
to her shall we go home my
with a long breath he
dispersed under the impression which he
had originated that he
in the passages the
gates were being closed with a jar
a rattle and the
morrow morning s interest
gallows pillory whipping post and branding iron
repeople it walking between her father and
a hackney coach was
and the father and daughter departed
it mr stryver had left them in
passages to shoulder his way back
the robing room another
who had not joined the group or
out after the rest and
looked on until the coach drove
he now stepped up to where mr
so mr lorry men
business may speak to mr darnay now
s part in the
s proceedings nobody had known
was none the better for it
conflict goes on in the business
when the business mind is divided between
said warmly you have mentioned that before
serve a house are not
house more than ourselves i know i
good as another i have no
better i dare say and indeed sir
me as very much your elder for
so i really don t
that it is your business
bless you i have no
said mr carton it is a
if you had pursued
lorry perhaps you would
to it lord love you
and a very respectable thing and sir
silences and impediments mr darnay as a
gentleman of generosity knows how
make allowance for that circumstance mr darnay
life chair there perhaps
well as with the barrister mr lorry
into the chair and was carried
to tellson s carton who smelt
port wine and did not
then and turned to darnay this
a strange chance that
a strange night to you standing alone
stones i hardly seem yet returned
darnay to belong to this world
i don t wonder
to another you speak
why the devil don t you
i dined myself while those
were deliberating which world you should belong
this or some other let
well at drawing his arm
his own he took him down
were shown into a
room where charles darnay was
recruiting his strength with a good plain
and good wine while carton
with his separate bottle of
before him and his fully
insolent manner upon him do you
yet that you belong to this terrestrial
again mr darnay i am frightfully confused
time and place but
am so far mended as
immense satisfaction he said
me the greatest desire i have
it has no good
it for me except wine like this
not much alike in
particular indeed i begin to think we
you and i confused
the emotion of the
and feeling his being
with this double of coarse deportment to
answer finally answered not at all now
don t you call
health mr darnay why don
why it s on
it s there miss manette then miss
in the face while
drank the toast carton flung his
over his shoulder against the
another that s a fair young lady
the dark mr darnay he
ruing his new goblet a slight
the answer that s
and wept for by how does it
is it worth being
for one s life to be the
mr darnay again darnay answered not a
she was mightily pleased to
your message when i gave it her
but i suppose she was the allusion
as a timely reminder to
that this disagreeable companion had of his
free will assisted him in the
dialogue to that point and thanked him
nor merit any was the
the first place and
don t know why i did
i have not asked myself
question but ask yourself the question now
do but i don
i do said carton i begin
understanding nevertheless pursued darnay rising to
the bell there is nothing
that i hope to
my calling the reckoning and
in life darnay rang do
call the whole reckoning said carton
his answering in the affirmative then bring
another pint of this
at ten the bill being
with something of a
think you have been drinking
carton think you know i have
so i know it then you shall
on earth cares for me
to be regretted you might have
you don t know what it
come to good night when he
a candle went to
wall and surveyed himself
in it do you particularly
the man he muttered at
own image why should you particularly like
man who resembles you there
nothing in you to like you
a change you have made in
to a man that he shows
you might have been
looked at by those blue eyes as
was and commiserated by that agitated face
in plain words you hate the
consolation drank it all in
table and a long winding
in the candle dripping down upon him
most men drank hard so very
is the improvement time
brought about in such habits that a
statement of the quantity
man would swallow in the
of a night without any detriment to
reputation as a perfect gentleman
seem in these days a
exaggeration the learned profession of the

other learned profession in its bacchanalian
shouldering his way to a large

in the drier parts of

the old bailey and
at the sessions mr
had begun cautiously to hew
the lower staves of the ladder
of mr stryver might be daily seen
out of the bed of wigs
way at the sun
among a rank garden full of flaring
it had once been noted at the
that while mr stryver was a glib
and an unscrupulous and a
and a bold he had not
faculty of extracting the essence from a
of statements which is among
most striking and necessary
his power seemed to grow
getting at its pith and marrow
however late at night he
carousing with sydney carton he
had his points at
unpromising of men was stryver s
ally what the two
together between hilary term and
might have floated a

to get to sleep again which
man dexterously combated by stirring
fire continuously for five minutes

who never assisted at
his slippers on and
loose bed gown and his
was bare for his greater ease he
eyes which may be
his class from the
of jeffries downward and which can

said stryver about the usual time
may be a quarter of an hour
they went into a
littered with papers where
was a blazing fire a kettle
the day s client
seeing him dine it
all one that was
by it when did
strike you i thought he
rather a handsome fellow and i
i should have been much
his precocious paunch you and your
sydney get to work get to
sullenly enough the jackal
adjoining room and came
water and partially wringing them
in a manner hideous to

to night memory said
worst first there they are sydney fire
the lion then composed
on his back on a
the jackal sat at his own
glasses ready to his hand both
to the drinking table without
but each in a different way
or occasionally flirting with some lighter document
so deep in his task that his

from these pilgrimages to the
and basin he returned with such
of damp headgear as
length the jackal had
and proceeded to offer it
him the lion took
the repast was fully discussed
lion put his hands
mediate the jackal then invigorated himself
a bum for his
and a fresh application
of a second meal this was administered
was not disposed of until the clocks
three in the morning and now
have done sydney fill a bumper
towels from his head
had been steaming again shook
yawned shivered and complied you were very
sydney in the matter of those
witnesses to day every question told
not i don t gainsay it
has roughened your temper put
punch to it and
it again with a deprecatory
sydney carton of old shrewsbury school
stryver nodding his head over
the present and the past
old seesaw sydney up one minute and
now in despondency ah returned the
i did exercises for other
and seldom did my
and why not god knows it
my way i suppose he

legs stretched out before
looking at the fire carton
his friend squaring himself at him

old sydney carton of old shrewsbury
lame way you summon
energy and purpose look

humoured laugh don t you

help you i suppose but it s
worth your while to apostrophise me or

ceremony but my opinion is
he laughed again and
both laughed before shrewsbury and
shrewsbury and ever since
pursued carton you have
into your rank and i have
into mine even when we were fellow
in the student quarter of paris
up french and french law and
french crumbs that we didn
were always somewhere and i was
nowhere and whose fault was that
shouldering and passing to that restless degree
i had no chance
my life but in rust
repose it s a gloomy thing
to talk about one s
go well then pledge me to
up his glass are you
in a pleasant direction apparently
for he became gloomy again pretty witness
muttered looking down into his
witnesses to day and to night
s your pretty witness
why man alive she was
admiration of the whole court
court who made the old bailey a
of beauty she was a
haired doll do you know
face do you know
rather thought at the time
happened to the golden haired doll quick
or two of a

without a perspective glass i
bed when his host followed
out on the staircase with a
to light him down the stairs
grimy windows when he got out
cold and sad the dull sky
like a lifeless desert and wreaths of
were spinning round and
before the morning blast as
the desert sand had risen far
and the first spray of
in its advance had begun to
a desert all around this man
still on his way across a silent
the wilderness before him a mirage of
the fair city of this vision there
airy galleries from which the loves and
of hope that sparkled in
sight a moment and it
gone climbing to a high chamber
bed and its pillow
upon no sadder sight than
man of good abilities and good
incapable of his own help and
him and resigning himself to let it
lodgings of doctor manette were in a
street corner not far from soho
sunday when the waves
four months had roiled over the
for treason and carried it as to
public interest and memory far
along the sunny streets from clerkenwell where
the doctor after several relapses
business absorption mr lorry had become
doctor s friend and the quiet street
was the sunny part of
life on this certain
sunday mr lorry walked
soho early in the afternoon for
reasons of habit firstly because on fine
he often walked out before dinner with
doctor and lucie secondly because
unfavourable sundays he was accustomed
to be found in
front windows of the
vista of street that had a congenial
of retirement on it there
oxford road and forest
flourished and wild flowers grew and the
blossomed in the now vanished fields
a consequence country airs circulated
soho with vigorous freedom instead of
without a settlement and there
many a good south wall not far
on which the peaches ripened in their
the day but when the
grew hot the corner was
into a glare of
it was a cool
to have been a tranquil bark
such an anchorage and there was the
stiff house where several
purported to be pursued by day but
little was audible any day
which was shunned by
of them at night in a
at the back attainable
be made and silver to
chased and likewise gold to
had a golden arm
out of the wall of the
hall as if he had beaten himself
very little of these trades or
or of a dim coach
was ever heard or seen
on traversed the hall or
stranger peered about there or a
clink was heard across the courtyard
a thump from the golden giant these
the rule that the sparrows
the plane tree behind the
and the echoes in the
such patients here as his old reputation
whispers of his story brought him
scientific knowledge and his vigilance
skill in conducting ingenious experiments brought him
as he wanted these things were
mr jarvis lorry s knowledge thoughts and
when he rang the door bell
the tranquil house in the
at home expected home miss lucie
home expected home miss pross
a certainty impossible for handmaid to
or denial of the
as i am at home myself said
lorry i ll go upstairs
of the country of her birth she
to have innately derived
it that ability to make much of
means which is one of
most useful and most agreeable characteristics
as the furniture was it was set
and fancy that its effect was delightful
disposition of everything in
the least the arrangement of colours the
variety and contrast obtained by
in trifles by delicate hands clear eyes
good sense were at once so
in themselves and so expressive of their
that as mr lorry stood looking
they communicated being put open that the
might pass freely through them all
him walked from one to another
first was the best room
in it were lucie
box of water colours
second was the doctor s consulting
in a corner stood
disused shoemaker s bench and tray
tools much as it
wonder said mr lorry pausing in his
about that he keeps that reminder
his sufferings about him and
strong of hand whose acquaintance
had first made at
royal george hotel at dover and had
improved i should have
mr lorry began pooh you d
mr lorry left off
then sharply and yet
bore him no malice
said miss pross i am
or you ll fidget me to
said miss pross whose character
mr lorry as an
really is bad enough returned miss
but better yes i am
much put out may
t want dozens of people who
not at all worthy of ladybird to
here looking after her
purpose hundreds said miss
it was characteristic of this lady as
some other people before her time
said mr lorry as
paid me for it which she
should never have done you may
for nothing since she was
years old and it s
very hard said miss pross
seeing with precision what was
important part of himself as
sort of fairy cloak that
fit anything all sorts of
who are not in
are always turning up said miss pross
you began it i began it miss
didn t you who brought her
it said mr lorry
wasn t ending it i suppose
that anybody should be under any
and trebly hard to have crowds and
of people turning up after him i
have forgiven him to take
s affections away from me mr lorry
he also knew her
this time to be beneath
service of her eccentricity
among women who will
pure love and admiration bind themselves
slaves to youth when they have lost
to beauty that they never had
gain to bright hopes that never shone
their own sombre lives
there is nothing in it
heart so rendered and
free from any mercenary taint
had such an exalted respect for it
in the retributive arrangements
such arrangements more or less he stationed
pross much nearer to
lower angels than many ladies
better got up both by nature and
who had balances at tellson s there
was nor will be
one man worthy of
solomon if he hadn t made a
personal history had established the fact that
had stripped her of
she possessed as a stake to
with and had abandoned her in
miss pross s fidelity
was quite a serious matter
to be alone for the
business he said when they
got back to the
relations let me ask you does
doctor in talking with lucie never
to the shoemaking time yet never
pross shaking her head but
don t say he don t refer
believe that he thinks of it much
do said miss pross do you imagine
him up short with
imagine anything have no imagination at
you go so far as to
sometimes now and then said miss pross
his own preserved through all those
relative to the cause of
being so oppressed perhaps even to the
of his oppressor i don t suppose
about it but what
tells me and that is that she
my asking all these questions
i am a mere dull man of
and you are a woman of
dull miss pross inquired
placidity rather wishing his
of any crime as
not say with me though he
business relations with me
will say with the
daughter to whom he is so
devotedly attached to him believe
of curiosity but out
zealous interest well to the best of
understanding and bad s the best you
tell me said miss
softened by the tone
the apology he is afraid of the
a dreadful remembrance besides
his loss of himself grew out of
may never feel certain of
wouldn t make the
pleasant i should think it was a
said he and fearful to reflect upon
manette to have that suppression always shut
and the uneasiness it sometimes
our present confidence can t be
said miss pross shaking
he instantly changes for the worse better
it alone in short
no like sometimes he gets up
heard by us overhead there
up and down walking
and down in his room
has learnt to know then that his
is walking up and down walking up
up and down walking up
says a word of the true
and she finds it best
silence they go walking up
down together walking up and down
him to himself notwithstanding
there was a perception of the pain
idea in her repetition
the phrase walking up and
which testified to her
such a thing the corner has
that it seemed as though
fro had set it going
they are said miss pross rising
now we shall have
of people pretty soon it was such
curious corner in its acoustical properties such
peculiar ear of a place that
looking for the father
the steps had gone but echoes
other steps that never came
would die away for good
they seemed close at hand however
pross was ready at the street door
receive them miss pross was a pleasant
off her darling s bonnet when
mantle ready for laying by and
her rich hair with as much
handsomest of women her darling
a pleasant sight too
for her which last she
dared to do playfully or miss pross
hurt would have retired to her
chamber and cried the doctor was
pleasant sight too looking on
them and telling miss
and with eyes that had as
spoiling in them as miss pross
and would have had more
it were possible mr lorry was
pleasant sight too beaming at all
in his little wig and
but no hundreds of people came to
the sights and mr lorry looked
miss pross s prediction dinner time
regions and always acquitted herself
her dinners of a
in their contrivances half
the thoroughly practical kind she had ravaged
and the adjacent provinces
and half crowns would
culinary mysteries to her
these decayed sons and daughters
gaul she had acquired such
arts that the woman and girl
as quite a sorceress or
s godmother who would send
two from the garden and change them
at the doctor s table but on
days persisted in taking her
room on the second floor a blue
to which no one but her ladybird
pross responding to ladybird s
face and pleasant efforts to
her unbent exceedingly so
be carried out under the plane tree
the air as everything turned upon
under the plane tree
she carried the wine down for
she had installed herself some
before as mr lorry s cup bearer
plane tree talking she kept his glass
peeped at them as they talked
in its own way above their
still the hundreds of people
not present themselves mr darnay presented
while they were sitting under
only one doctor manette received
kindly and so did lucie
miss pross suddenly became afflicted
a twitching in the head and
and retired into the house
was not unfrequently the victim of this
and she called it in familiar conversation
lucie was very strong at such
and as they sat side by
trace the likeness he had
talking all day on many
they sat under the plane tree and
said it in the natural pursuit
happened to be the old buildings of
casually we have seen enough of it
know that it teems with interest
more i have been there as you
and not in a
that gives facilities for
a curious thing when i was
making some alterations the workmen came
of its inner wall was
by inscriptions which had been carved
prisoners dates names complaints and
the wall one prisoner who seemed to
done with some very poor
d i c but on being more
examined the last letter was found
be g there was
fruitless guesses were made what
name could have been at length
initials but the complete
dig the floor was examined very carefully
the inscription and in the earth
a stone or tile or
or bag what the
prisoner had written will
be read but he had written
and hidden it away to keep it
the gaoler my father exclaimed lucie you
ill he had suddenly started
with his hand to his head his
and his look quite terrified them
no my dear not ill there are
drops of rain falling and
made me start we had
instantly rain was really
back of his hand with rain drops
in reference to the discovery

it detected on his

of the court house he recovered
so quickly however that
lorry had doubts of
giant in the hall was not more
stopped under it to remark to
that he was not yet proof against
surprises if he ever would be
that the rain had startled him tea
with another fit of
but he made only two the night
so very sultry that
they sat with doors
with they all moved to
the heavy twilight lucie sat
her father darnay sat beside her carton
against a window the curtains
long and white and some of
thunder gusts that whirled into
corner caught them up to the
and waved them like spectral wings
rain drops are still falling large heavy
comes slowly it comes surely said carton
for lightning always do there
a great hurry in the streets of
before the storm broke the wonderful
echoes of footsteps coming and
yet not a footstep was
a multitude of people
listened for a while is
not impressive mr darnay asked
of an evening until i have fancied
me shudder to night when all
so black and solemn let us
too we may know what it is
will seem nothing to
such whims are only
as we originate them i think
sat alone here of an evening listening
i have made the echoes
footsteps that are coming by and bye
coming one day into our lives if
in in his moody way
became more and more rapid the
of feet some as it seemed
the windows some as
seemed in the room
coming some going some breaking off
streets and not one within sight
all these footsteps destined
come to all of us miss manette
are we to divide them among us
don t know mr
i told you it

of the people who are

stipulations there is a
crowd bearing down upon
miss manette and i see them by

a peal of thunder here they come
fierce and furious it was the
heard in it a
storm of thunder and lightning broke
not a moment s interval
crash and fire and
until after the moon

patches of road on
way between soho and

mr lorry to bring the
out of their graves i
good night mr carton
the man of business good night mr
shall we ever see such a night
great crowd of people with
rush and roar bearing down upon
too vii monseigneur in town monseigneur
his grand hotel in paris monseigneur was
his inner room his sanctuary of
the holiest of holiests to the
monseigneur was about to take his
monseigneur could swallow a great
things with ease and was
some few sullen minds supposed to be
rapidly swallowing france but his
s chocolate could not
much as get into the throat of
without the aid of four
took four men all four
with gorgeous decoration and the
by monseigneur to conduct the happy chocolate
sacred presence a second milled
bore for that function
third presented the favoured napkin a
he of the two gold watches poured
chocolate out it was impossible for monseigneur
on the chocolate and hold his high
on by only three men he
been out at a little supper last
where the comedy and the grand
little supper most nights with fascinating
so polite and so impressible was
that the comedy and the grand opera
far more influence with him
the tiresome articles of state affairs
state secrets than the needs
all france a happy circumstance for france
the merry stuart who
it monseigneur had one
noble idea of general public business
was to let everything go on in
own way of particular
all go his way tend to
own power and pocket of his pleasures
and particular monseigneur had the other truly
idea that the world was
his order altered from the
by only a pronoun
and the fulness thereof
mine saith monseigneur yet
had slowly found that vulgar
private and public and he had
to finances public because monseigneur
must consequently let them out to somebody
could as to finances private
farmer generals were rich and monseigneur
generations of great luxury
expense was growing poor hence monseigneur had
had bestowed her as
was now among the company in
outer rooms much prostrated
mankind of the blood
included looked down upon him with the
contempt a sumptuous man was the farmer
thirty horses stood in his stables
four male domestics sat
his halls six body
waited on his wife
nothing but plunder and forage where he
the farmer general howsoever his matrimonial
who attended at the hotel
a beautiful scene to look at
in truth not a sound business considered
any reference to the
in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere and
that the watching towers
they would have been an
civil officers without a
and looser lives all totally
for their several callings all lying
in pretending to belong
monseigneur and therefore foisted
all public employments from which anything was
any straight road to any
who made great fortunes out of
upon their courtly patients
projectors who had discovered
remedy of setting to work in earnest
root out a single
poured their distracting babble
any ears they could
hold of at the reception
the world with words
making card towers of babel to
the skies with talked with unbelieving
transmutation of metals at this wonderful
accumulated by monseigneur exquisite gentlemen of
time and has been
to be known by its
most exemplary state of exhaustion at
hotel of monseigneur such homes
these various notabilities left behind
in the fine world
paris that the spies among the
devotees of monseigneur forming a
half of the polite company would
found it hard to
among the angels of
sphere one solitary wife who in her
and appearance owned to
a mother indeed except
the mere act of
the name of mother
was no such thing known to the
peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close
a dozen exceptional people who
had for a few years
a promising way of setting
of convulsionists and were even then considering
themselves whether they should
finger post to the
for monseigneur s guidance besides
dervishes were other three who had rushed
another sect which mended matters with a
about the centre of truth holding that
had got out of the
to be kept from flying
even to be shoved
spirits went on and it did a
but the comfort was that all
company at the grand hotel of
judgment had only been
gallant swords to look at and
of smell would surely keep anything
for ever and ever the exquisite gentlemen
the finest breeding wore
these golden fetters rang like precious little
and what with that
and with the rustle of silk
in the air that fanned
antoine and his devouring hunger far
dress was the one
keeping all things in their places
was dressed for a fancy ball
was never to leave
from the palace of the
the scarecrows the fancy ball
to the common executioner who
pursuance of the charm was
to officiate frizzled powdered in a gold
coat pumps and white silk stockings at
professors of the provinces monsieur orleans
the rest to call
presided in this dainty
monseigneur s reception in that seventeen hundred
in a frizzled hangman powdered gold
having eased his four
of their burdens and taken his
holiest of holiests to be thrown
and issued forth then what
what cringing and fawning what servility
body and spirit nothing in
which may have been one among
reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur
troubled it bestowing a word of
here and a smile there
of the hand on another monseigneur
passed through his rooms to
remote region of the circumference
back again and so in due
in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites
was seen no more the show
over the flutter in
air became quite a little storm
was soon but one person left of
the crowd and he with his
mirrors on his way out i devote
on his way and turning in
direction of the sanctuary
the devil with that he
the snuff from his
as if he had shaken the
was a man of about sixty
dressed haughty in manner and
face of a transparent paleness every feature
in those two compressions or
the only little change that the
ever showed resided they persisted in
colour sometimes and they would be occasionally
then they gave a look of
and cruelty to the
countenance examined with attention
capacity of helping such a look
of the mouth and the lines of
orbits of the eyes being much too
handsome face and a remarkable one
not many people had talked with him
in a little space
and monseigneur might have been warmer in
circumstances rather agreeable to him to see
enemy and the furious recklessness
the man brought no check into the
itself audible even in that deaf
without footways the fierce patrician custom
hard driving endangered and maimed
to think of it a
as in all others the common
were left to get out of
difficulties as they could
a wild rattle and clatter and
inhuman abandonment of consideration
easy to be understood in these
children out of its way
last swooping at a street
to a sickening little jolt and there
a loud cry from
and plunged but for
latter inconvenience the carriage
often known to drive on and leave
wounded behind and why not but
frightened valet had got
in a hurry and
were twenty hands at the horses
calmly looking out a tall man
a nightcap had caught
a bundle from among the feet
the horses and had laid
on the basement of the
and was down in
like a wild animal pardon monsieur the
said a ragged and
he make that abominable noise is it
child excuse me monsieur the
it is a pity
the fountain was a little
for the street opened where it was
a space some ten
twelve yards square as the
man suddenly got up
the carriage monsieur the marquis clapped
hand for an instant on
sword hilt killed shrieked the man in
his head and staring at him
the people closed round
looked at monsieur the marquis
or anger neither did the people
been silent and they remained so the
they had been mere rats come out
it is extraordinary to
for ever in the way how
have done my horses see give him
he threw out a
the eyes might look
man called out again with a
unearthly cry dead he
of another man for
miserable creature fell upon his
sobbing and crying and pointing
bundle and moving gently
it they were as silent however as
all said the last comer be a
man my gaspard it is
for the poor little plaything to
so than to live it has
in a moment without pain
the marquis smiling how
they call you they call me
of what trade monsieur
marquis vendor of wine pick up
philosopher and vendor of wine said the
it as you will
horses there are they right without
a gentleman who had
pay for it when his ease
suddenly disturbed by a coin
into his carriage and ringing on
floor hold said monsieur the marquis
the horses who threw that
looked to the spot where defarge the
of wine had stood a moment
but the wretched father was grovelling
his face on the pavement in that
and the figure that
a dark stout woman knitting you
very willingly and exterminate you from
near it he should be crushed
the wheels so cowed was their
and so long and hard their
do to them within the
one but the woman who stood
looked up steadily and looked the
in the face it was not for
dignity to notice it his
eyes passed over her and
all the other rats and
the word go on he was
on and other carriages
whirling by in quick succession the minister

by the rats had crept out of
holes to look on and they
looking on for hours soldiers and police
passing between them and the spectacle
making a barrier behind which they
and through which they

with it when the women
on the base of the fountain sat
the rolling of the fancy ball
the one woman who
the water of the fountain

ran into evening so much life in
city ran into death according
fancy ball was lighted up
but not abundant patches of poor
where corn should have been patches of
peas and beans patches of most
women who cultivated it a prevalent

unwillingly a dejected disposition to give
the marquis was no
of his high breeding it
not from within it was occasioned
an external circumstance beyond his control the
sun the sunset struck so brilliantly
the travelling carriage when it gained the
top that its occupant was steeped
crimson it will die out
monsieur the marquis glancing at
so low that it dipped at
slid down hill with a cinderous smell
the marquis going down together
remained a broken country bold
the hill a broad
and rise beyond it a church
the chase and a crag with
fortress on it used as a
round upon all these

yard for relays of post horses poor
all usual poor appointments it had its

that there was any

like about their heads in the
furies monsieur the marquis
up in his travelling carriage at
posting house gate it was
by the fountain and the peasants
that was to make the meagreness
survive the truth through
marquis cast his eyes over the
of himself had drooped before monseigneur of
court only the difference was that these
roads joined the group
the courier the fellow was brought cap
round to look and listen
paris fountain i passed

being passed on the road
up the hill and at the top
the hill both monseigneur
look at so fixedly monseigneur i looked
the man he stooped
little and with his
of the shoe the drag who demanded
carry away these idiots how do you
the man you know all
men of this part of
country who was he
clemency monseigneur he was not
this part of the country of all
days of my life i never

with your gracious permission
was the wonder of
monseigneur his head hanging over
his face thrown up to the sky
his head hanging down
recovered himself fumbled with his cap and
monseigneur he was whiter than the miller
tall as a spectre
at monsieur the marquis perhaps
conscience truly you did well said
marquis felicitously sensible that such vermin were
to ruffle him to
a thief accompanying my carriage and not

accursed was already under the carriage with
half dozen particular friends pointing out the
half dozen other particular friends
to monsieur the marquis
for the drag monseigneur he
himself over the hill side head first
a person plunges into the river
half dozen who were peering

they had very little else

into the dun distance at
a poor figure in
done by some inexperienced
carver but he had studied the

emblem of a great distress
had long been growing
a woman was kneeling she
her head as the carriage
herself at the carriage door it is

a brisk trot the postilions

rain falls impartially on the
the fountain not far away
whom the mender of

blue cap without which he was nothing

ago up the broad
of shallow steps monsieur the marquis flambeau
great pile of stable building away among
trees all else was so quiet
the flambeau carried up the steps
in a close room
state instead of being in the
night air other sound
the owl s voice there was
breath by the hour
and hold their breath again the
old boar spears swords and knives
the chase grimmer with certain
riding rods and riding whips
which many a peasant
to his benefactor death had felt
avoiding the larger rooms which were
night monsieur the marquis with
flambeau bearer going on before
up the staircase to a
in a corridor this thrown open
him to his own private
and two others high vaulted
with cool uncarpeted floors great dogs upon
hearths for the burning of wood
winter time and all luxuries
the state of a
one of the line
was never to break
furniture but it was diversified by many
in the third of the
a round room in
of the chateau s four
topped towers a small lofty room
its window wide open
the wooden jalousie blinds closed so
horizontal lines of black alternating
their broad lines of stone colour
nephew said the marquis
nor was he but he
will arrive to night nevertheless
the table as it
quarter of an hour
a quarter of an hour monseigneur was
his sumptuous and choice supper
chair was opposite to the window and
that he calmly asked looking with attention
the horizontal lines of black and stone
monseigneur that outside the blinds open
blinds it was done well monseigneur it
that are here the
who spoke had thrown the blinds wide
them again that was
with his glass in his
hearing the sound of wheels
the front of the

at the posting houses as being
little while he came he had
known in england as
darnay monseigneur received him
a courtly manner but they did not
at table yesterday and you
come direct from london yes

said the marquis with a smile on
contrary i come direct
long time on the journey a
detained by the nephew stopped a moment
polished uncle so long as a servant
between them when coffee had been
the nephew looking at the uncle
conversation i have come
sir as you anticipate pursuing the
to death said the uncle
is not necessary to say to
if it had carried me
the utmost brink of death you
have cared to stop me there the
the lengthening of the
straight lines in the cruel face
ominous as to that the uncle
a graceful gesture of protest which
so clearly a slight form of good
that it was not reassuring indeed
pursued the nephew for anything
worked to give a more suspicious appearance
me no no no
the uncle pleasantly but however
would stop me by any
and would know no scruple
to means my friend
told you so said
the two marks do me the
to recall that i
you so long ago i
very sweetly indeed his tone lingered in
instrument in effect sir pursued the
i believe it to be at
your bad fortune and my good fortune
has kept me out of
prison in france here i do
were not in disgrace
the court and had not been
by that cloud for
past a letter de cachet would have
possible said the uncle with great calmness
the honour of the family i
that extent pray excuse me
one observed the nephew i
i would not be
of that a good
might influence your destiny to far greater
but it is useless to discuss the
i am as you
at a disadvantage these little instruments of
power and honour of families these slight
that might so incommode
are only to be obtained now by
and importunity they are sought
so many and they
granted comparatively to so few it
not to be so
the worse our not
ancestors held the right of life and
many such dogs have been
out to be hanged in the
room my bedroom one fellow to our
was poniarded on the spot for professing
insolent delicacy respecting his daughter his daughter
have lost many privileges a new philosophy
become the mode and the assertion
to say would but might cause us
inconvenience all very bad very
the marquis took a gentle little pinch
as elegantly despondent as
still containing himself that
means of regeneration we
so asserted our station both in
time also said the nephew gloomily that
of the high is the involuntary
at me with any deference
marquis to the grandeur of
in which the family has sustained
crossed his legs but when
nephew leaning an elbow on the table
with his hand the fine mask
of keenness closeness and dislike
was comportable with its wearer
assumption of indifference repression is the only
my friend observed the marquis will keep
this roof looking up to it shuts
picture of the chateau as it was
fifty like it as
few years hence could have
to claim his own from the
the roof he vaunted he
have found that shutting out the sky
a new way to
of the bodies into which its lead
fired out of the
of a hundred thousand muskets meanwhile
must be fatigued shall
terminate our conference for the
a moment more an hour if you
sir said the nephew
have done wrong and are
the fruits of wrong we have done
repeated the marquis with an
smile and delicately pointing first to his
then to himself our
both of us in such
speak of my father
separate my father s twin brother
inheritor and next successor from
death has done that said the marquis
has left me answered the
bound to a system that
the last request of my dear mother
my dear mother s eyes
assistance and power in vain
them from me my
said the marquis touching him
the breast with his forefinger they
now standing by the hearth you will
ever seek them in vain
assured every fine straight line in
clear whiteness of his face was
looking quietly at his nephew with his
him on the breast as
point of a small sword with
in delicate finesse he ran him
the body and said
friend i will die perpetuating
system under which i have lived when
culminating pinch of snuff
put his box in his pocket
he added then after ringing a
bell on the table and accept your
destiny but you are lost monsieur charles
renounce them are they both yours to
france may be but is the
is it yet i had no intention
the words i used
i have the vanity to hope
do me too much honour said the
still i prefer that supposition
would abandon it and live otherwise
it but a wilderness
misery and ruin hah
the marquis glancing round the luxurious room
the eye it is fair
under the sky and
the daylight it is
oppression hunger nakedness and suffering hah said
marquis again in a
it shall be put
some hands better qualified to free
slowly if such a
is possible from the weight that drags
on all this land and you said
uncle forgive my curiosity
to live i must
to live what others of
countrymen even with nobility at their
country the family name can suffer
me in no other for i
it in no other
ringing of the bell had caused
adjoining bed chamber to be lighted
now shone brightly through
door of communication the
looked that way and
for the retreating step of his
england is very attractive
there he observed then
his calm face to
nephew with a smile i have
there i am sensible i may be
boastful english that it is the refuge
found a refuge there a doctor
the marquis you are fatigued good
as he bent his head
his most courtly manner
was a secrecy in his smiling
nephew forcibly at the
time the thin straight lines of
the thin straight lips and the
the marquis a doctor with
daughter yes so commences the
it would have been
face outside the chateau as to interrogate
face of his the nephew looked
him in vain in
on to the door good
said the uncle i look to
in the morning good repose light monsieur
monsieur my nephew in his bed
his own bedroom the valet
that hot still night
slippered feet making no
like some enchanted marquis of the
wicked sort in story
periodical change into tiger form
he moved from end to end of
voluptuous bedroom looking again
the scraps of the day
journey that came unbidden
his mind the slow toil up the
prison on the crag the little
in the hollow the
mender of roads with
the paris fountain the little bundle
on the step the women bending over
and the tall man
his arms up crying dead i
cool now said monsieur
marquis and may go
bed so leaving only one light burning
gauze curtains fall around him and
sigh as he composed
to sleep the stone
three heavy hours for three
dogs barked and the
made a noise with
little resemblance in it to the noise
assigned to the owl by men poets
it is the obstinate custom of
what is set down
stone faces of the chateau
night dead darkness lay on
the landscape dead darkness
hushing dust on all the
to the pass that its
heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable
the cross might have come
for anything that could be
of it in the village taxers and
were fast asleep dreaming
of banquets as the starved usually do
of ease and rest as the
at the chateau dropped unseen and unheard
melting away like the minutes that were
from the spring of time
three dark hours then the grey water
in the light and the eyes of
stone faces of the chateau were opened
touched the tops of the still trees
poured its radiance over the
fountain seemed to turn to blood and
stone faces crimsoned the carol of the
was loud and high and on
weather beaten sill of the great window
the bed chamber of monsieur
its might at this the nearest stone
seemed to stare amazed
with open mouth and dropped under
up and movement began in
chilled as yet by
new sweet air then began the
lightened toil of the day among the
women here to dig and delve men
women there to see to the poor
stock and lead the bony
found by the roadside
breakfast among the weeds
became its quality but awoke gradually
of the chase had been reddened
in their stables looked round over
shoulders at the light and
pouring in at doorways leaves
hard at their chains and
these trivial incidents belonged to
surely not so the ringing
the great bell of the chateau nor
running up and down the stairs
booting and tramping here
there and everywhere nor the
saddling of horses and
away what winds conveyed
hurry to the grizzled mender of
already at work on
hill top beyond the village with his
s dinner not much to
was worth no crow s while to
had the birds carrying some grains
it to a distance dropped one over
sultry morning as if
his life down the hill knee high
he got to the fountain all
standing about in their depressed manner and
than grim curiosity and surprise
led cows hastily brought in
hold them were looking stupidly on or
down chewing the cud
the mender of roads
penetrated into the midst
friends and was smiting himself
what did all this
and what portended the swift hoisting
of monsieur gabelle behind
the said gabelle double laden
the horse was at
ballad of leonora it portended that
was one stone face too many up
the chateau the gorgon had
the building again in
night and had added the
stone face wanting the stone face

the marquis it was like a fine

into the heart of

carpenters as a tutor whose attainments made

work besides mere dictionary knowledge young
he was well acquainted more over
the circumstances of his

growing interest so with
to lie on beds
roses if he had had
it and did it and made the
of it in this his prosperity consisted
certain portion of his time was
at cambridge where he read with
the custom house the rest

lucie manette from the

it was confronted with his own
the edge of the grave that had
yet spoken to her on the subject
assassination at the deserted chateau far
beyond the heaving water and
which had itself become the mere
year and he had
single spoken word disclosed
heart that he had his reasons
was again a summer day when lately
he turned into the
corner in soho bent on
an opportunity of opening his
to doctor manette it was the
of the summer day and
knew lucie to be out with miss
he found the doctor reading in his
chair at a window the energy which
at once supported him under his old
and aggravated their sharpness had been gradually
to him he was now
very energetic man indeed with
firmness of purpose strength of
and vigour of action in
at first been in the exercise of
much slept little sustained a
deal of fatigue with ease and was
cheerful to him now entered charles darnay
his book and held out his hand
darnay i rejoice to
you we have been counting on your
these three or four days past mr
here yesterday and both made you
to be more than due
am obliged to them for their
a little coldly as
them though very warmly
to the doctor miss
stopped short and your return will
us all she has gone out
some household matters but
knew she was from home
took the opportunity of her being from
to beg to speak to
find the speaking on less easy
have had the happiness doctor manette
being so intimate here so he at
on which i am
to touch may not he was
by the doctor s putting out
hand to stop him when he had
topic she is it
any time it is very hard for
to hear her spoken of
homage and deep love doctor manette
said deferentially there was
blank silence before her father rejoined i
it his constraint was so manifest and
was so manifest too that
originated in an unwillingness to approach the
i say it how earnestly
and the hopes and fears
anxieties with which it has long
laden dear doctor manette i
your daughter fondly dearly disinterestedly devotedly if
there were love in the
i love her you
away and his eyes bent
not recall that his
ears long after he
ceased he motioned with the
he had extended and
the doctor in a
tone after some moments i do
satisfied of it he turned towards
not look at him or raise his
white hair overshadowed his face have
it would be ungenerous to
denial is to be
to your consideration for
did not go with it i
fail to know doctor
day to day that between you
miss manette there is an affection so
the circumstances in which it has been
that it can have
parallels even in the
between a father and child i know
manette how can i fail to
has become a woman there
in her heart towards you all
love and reliance of
childhood she had no parent so she
and character united to
trustfulness and attachment of the
you had been restored
her from the world beyond this life
which you are always with her
clinging to you the hands of
girl and woman all
one are round your
and loves her mother at her
age sees and loves you at my
loves you through your
trial and in your blessed restoration i
have known you in your
her father sat silent
was a little quickened but he repressed
other signs of agitation
doctor manette always knowing
always seeing her and
forborne and forborne as
man to do it i
between you is to touch
history with something not
mournfully i have thought so before
i believe it but do not believe
mournful voice struck with
my wife i must at any time
could or would breathe a word of
know it to be hopeless i should
it to be a baseness
i had any such
even at a remote distance
years harboured in my thoughts
hidden in my heart if
ever had been there
i could not now touch
honoured hand he laid his own upon
like you driven from it by its
oppressions and miseries like
own exertions and trusting in
her privilege as your child companion and
the arms of his chair and
up for the first time since the
of the conference a
was evidently in his face
struggle with that occasional
which had a tendency in
charles darnay that i thank you
all my heart and will open
have you any reason
believe that lucie loves
none as yet none
it the immediate object of this confidence
you may at once ascertain
with my knowledge not
so i might not
i might mistaken or not
seek any guidance from
i ask none sir but
have it in your
to give me some
me i do seek that what is
have no hope i well
that even if miss
innocent heart do not think
against her love for her
see what on the other hand
suitor s favour would outweigh herself
all the world for
reason doctor manette said darnay modestly
firmly i would not ask that word
of it charles darnay
wide division in the former case
are subtle and delicate
difficult to penetrate my daughter lucie
to me i can make no
at the state of her heart
supplied the rest is sought by
other suitor it is what i
he answered you have
mr carton here yourself mr stryver
not thought of both i should
what it is it is
if miss manette should bring to you
any time on her
ventured to lay before
you will bear testimony to what
it i hope you may be able
think so well of me
i say nothing more of my
i will observe immediately i give
promise said the doctor without any condition
to perpetuate and not to
other and far dearer self
she should ever tell me that you
man had taken his hand gratefully
fancies any reasons any apprehensions
whatsoever new or old
the man she really loved
direct responsibility thereof not lying on
than suffering more to me than wrong
idle talk so strange was the
in which he faded into
darnay felt his own hand
released and dropped it you
something to me said doctor
breaking into a smile what
of a condition relieved as
mind reverted to that
ought to be returned with
mother s is not as you will
am in england stop
the doctor of beauvais i
it that i may the better
your confidence and have no
even had his two hands at his
for another instant even had
s lips tell me when i
you not now if your suit should
if lucie should love you
hand she will be home directly
you it was dark when
darnay left him and it was
room alone for miss
chair empty my father she
to him father dear
was said in answer but she
running back frightened crying to herself
do her uncertainty lasted but a
she hurried back and tapped at his
of her voice and he presently came
her bed to look at him in
his tray of shoemaking tools and
a companion picture sydney said mr

the night a correspondingly extra quantity
wine had preceded the towelling and
was in a very
which he had steeped it
intervals for the last
glancing round from the sofa

quite as shrewd as
usually do think me i intend
i am not going to guess
five o clock in the morning with
brains frying and sputtering in
head if you want me to guess
must ask me to dinner
then i ll tell
said stryver coming slowly into a sitting
making myself intelligible to you because you
such a sensitive and poetical spirit
prefer any claim to being the
of romance for i
am a tenderer sort
fellow than you you
a luckier if you mean that
don t mean that
you are about it
carton well i ll say gallantry my
is that i am a man said
inflating himself at his
as he made the
who takes more pains to be agreeable
before i go on said stryver shaking
i ll have this out with you

your manners have been of that
and sullen and hangdog kind that upon
in your practice at the
to be ashamed of anything returned sydney

the punch he had made and
agreeable than you have being
it i never saw you do it
muttered carton i do
because it s politic

the question with some appearance of
in no very soothing tone i
no business to be at all

did certainly and in these
made mention of the young
as a golden haired doll the young
is miss manette if you had
a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy
i might have been a little
are not you want that sense
i think of the expression
i should be annoyed by a man
opinion of a picture of
a piece of music of mine who
no ear for music sydney
drank the punch at a
rate drank it by bumpers looking at
friend now you know
stryver i don t care
fortune she is a charming creature
i have made up my mind
please myself on the
i think i can afford to
myself she will have in
a man already pretty well off and
rapidly rising man and a
piece of good fortune for her but
is worthy of good
punch rejoined why should i be
why should i not approve well said
friend stryver you take it
easily than i fancied you would

than i thought you would be though
be sure you know well
by this time that your
strong will yes sydney
as a change from it i
that it is a
thing for a man to
to go to it

and be ill and poor

as he was and
times as offensive now let me

it nor tact for it find out
way or lodging letting way
that s the kind of thing for
now think of it sydney i ll
of it said sydney xii the fellow
delicacy mr stryver having made up his
fortune on the doctor s daughter resolved
make her happiness known to
after some mental debating
the point he came to
conclusion that it would
as well to get all the
the little christmas vacation
it and hilary as to
strength of his case he had
a doubt about it but clearly saw
ever worth taking into account
was a plain case and had
a weak spot in
was no getting over his
the counsel for the defendant
up his brief and the jury
not even turn to
after trying it stryver c
was satisfied that no plainer
could be accordingly mr
to take miss manette to
gardens that failing to ranelagh
mind towards soho therefore mr stryver shouldered
infancy was still upon it
who had seen him projecting himself
bar bursting in his full blown
along the pavement to
way taking him past tellson s
mr lorry as the intimate
stryver s mind to enter the bank
the door with the
rattle in its throat
down the two steps
shouldered himself into the musty back closet
mr lorry sat at
bars to his window as if that
stryver how do you do i
you are well it was stryver
grand peculiarity that he always seemed
big for any place or space he
so much too big
house itself magnificently reading the paper
into its responsible waistcoat the discreet mr
do sir and shook
there was a peculiarity in
manner of shaking hands always
be seen in any clerk at
s who shook hands with a
co can i do anything for
mr stryver asked mr lorry in his
this is a private visit to
mr lorry i have
for a private word oh indeed said
lorry bending down his ear while his
arms confidentially on the desk whereupon
enough for him i am going to
agreeable little friend miss manette mr lorry
dear me cried mr lorry rubbing
you could desire but really you know
stryver mr lorry paused
manner as if he
compelled against his will
with his contentious hand opening
eyes wider and taking
long breath if i understand you mr
adjusted his little wig
and bit the feather of a
d n it all sir said
staring at him am i not
oh dear yes yes oh yes you
eligible said mr lorry if you

to advancing you know said
another admission nobody can doubt that
what on earth is

his fist on the desk then i
ll put you in a corner forensically
go because said mr lorry i wouldn
go on such an object
having some cause to believe
i should succeed d n me cried
the distant house and glanced at
a man of years a man
experience in a bank said stryver
having summed up three leading reasons
it with his head on mr stryver
upon the peculiarity as if
would have been infinitely
head off when i speak
success i speak of
speak of causes and
to make success probable i speak
lady my good sir
mr lorry mildly tapping the stryver arm
young lady the young
elbows that it is
deliberate opinion that the young lady
any man which i hope i
not whose taste was so
he could not restrain
s should prevent my
him a piece of my mind the
put mr stryver s
vessels into a dangerous
when it was his
to be angry mr lorry s veins
as their courses could usually be were
no better state now
a little while and then stood hitting
tune out of his teeth
it which probably gave him the toothache
deliberately advise me not to
up to soho and offer
my self stryver of the king s
it correctly and all i can
of it is laughed stryver with
vexed laugh that this
ha beats everything past present and to
now understand me pursued mr lorry as
man of business i am not justified
a man of business i know
of it but as an old fellow
has carried miss manette in his arms
manette and of her
my seeking recollect now you think i
not be right not i said
whistling i can t undertake to find
parties in common sense i
mincing bread and butter nonsense

to correct my advice by the
for yourself if on the other hand

a question of a few
i could go to soho in
afterwards then i say yes said

that comes to i say yes
i shall expect you
stryver turned and burst out of the
causing such a concussion of
on his passage through
to stand up against
bowing behind the two counters required the
remaining strength of the
ancient clerks those venerable and feeble
were always seen by the public
the act of bowing and were popularly
when they had bowed
another customer in the barrister
keen enough to divine
the banker would not
gone so far in his expression of
on any less solid
he was for the
pill he had to swallow he
it down and now said mr
was down my way
of this is to put you
in the wrong it was a bit
the art of an
bailey tactician in which he found great
wrong young lady said mr stryver
ll do that for you
when mr lorry called
night as late as
less on his mind than
even showed surprise when he
in an absent and preoccupied
well said that good natured
after a full half hour of bootless
to bring him round
the question i have
to soho to soho repeated mr stryver
oh to be sure what am i
said mr lorry that i
right in the conversation
had my opinion is confirmed and
mr stryver in the friendliest way that
am sorry for it on your
and sorry for it
the poor father s
be a sore subject with
family let us say
understand you said mr lorry i dare
not rejoined stryver nodding his head
matter but it does
mr lorry urged no it doesn
having supposed that there was sense where
laudable ambition where there is
well out of my mistake
no harm is done young women
thing is dropped because it would have
a bad thing for me in
worldly point of view in a selfish
thing has dropped because it would have
a bad thing for me in
worldly point of view it
nothing by it there
no harm at all
i ever should have committed myself
cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses
it i tell you
me to sound you and
young lady better than i do
have done mr lorry was so taken
that he looked quite stupidly
an appearance of showering generosity forbearance and
on his erring head make the
of it my dear sir said stryver
again for allowing me to
the night before he knew where
xiii the fellow of no
never shone in the house of doctor
year and had always been
same moody and morose lounger there
the cloud of caring for nothing
house and for the senseless stones that
their pavements many a night he vaguely
unhappily wandered there when
lingering there when the first
of the sun brought
of churches and lofty buildings
some sense of better things else
and unattainable into his mind of
the neglected bed in the
court had known him more
than ever and often when
than a few minutes
neighbourhood on a day in august
jackal that he had thought
of that marrying matter had
his delicacy into devonshire and
the sight and scent of flowers in
of goodness in them for the
of health for the
oldest sydney s feet
trod those stones from
irresolute and purposeless his
and in the working out
that intention they took him to the
s door he was
quite at her ease with him
received him with some little embarrassment as
up at his face in
interchange of the first few common places
are not well mr carton no
the life i lead miss manette is
conducive to health what is
be expected of or by such
lips a pity to live
him again she was
were tears in his eyes there
it is too late
that i shall never be better
worse he leaned an elbow
her table and covered
eyes with his hand
her to be so without
down before the knowledge of
i want to say to you will
hear me if it will do you
glad god bless you
your sweet compassion he unshaded his face
be afraid to hear me
t shrink from anything i say
life might have been
mr carton i am sure that the
part of it might
be much much worthier
yourself say of you miss manette and
mystery of my own wretched heart
fixed despair of himself
made the interview unlike any
if it had been possible
manette that you could have returned
flung away wasted drunken poor
he would have been conscious
and repentance blight you disgrace you
you down with him i know
no tenderness for me
without it can i not
you mr carton can i not recall
forgive me again to a better course
i in no way repay
confidence i know this is a confidence
modestly said after a little hesitation and
earnest tears i know you would say
to no good account for
mr carton he shook his head to
no miss manette to none
a very little more all you can
wish you to know
you have been the last dream
the sight of you with your
such a home by you has stirred
shadows that i thought had died
of me since i knew you
have been troubled by a remorse that
upward that i thought
silent for ever i have
unformed ideas of striving afresh
anew shaking off sloth and sensuality
fighting out the abandoned
a dream all a dream that
he lay down but i
it remain o mr
miss manette all through it
have known myself to be quite undeserving
yet i have had the weakness
to know with what a
mastery you kindled me heap of
that i am into fire a fire
inseparable in its nature from myself
burning away since it
my misfortune mr carton to
made you more unhappy than
my becoming worse since
state of your mind that you
is at all events
make it plain can i use
no power for good with
that i am capable of now miss
i have come here to realise
life the remembrance that
something left in me
which i entreated you to believe again
again most fervently with all my heart
miss manette i have
i distress you i draw fast to
end will you let
reposed in your pure and
breast and that it lies
alone and will be shared by
one if that will be a consolation
you yes not even by
dearest one ever to be known
agitated pause the secret
it thank you and
god bless you he
the door be under
apprehension miss manette of my
resuming this conversation by so much
refer to it again if
were dead that could not be
than it is henceforth in
hold sacred the one
remembrance and shall thank and
and miseries were gently carried
your heart may it
unlike what he had ever shown himself
and how much he every day
down and perverted that lucie
wept mournfully for him as he

that way mr cruncher made out
some kind of funeral was coming
and that there was popular
to this funeral which engendered uproar

articles about him in skilful
he bestowed a parting
on mrs cruncher extinguished
only made a feint
long after his father under cover of
darkness he followed out of the

house again for it was full
night impelled by a laudable ambition to
the art and mystery of his father
honest calling young jerry keeping as
to house fronts walls and doorways
his honoured parent in view
by another disciple of izaak
and the two trudged on together within
the more than winking watchmen
were out upon a lonely road another
was picked up here and that
silently that if young jerry had been
the three went on
young jerry went on until the
stopped under a bank
wall surmounted by an iron railing
the shadow of bank
and up a blind lane of
eight or ten feet high formed one
peeping up the lane the
of his honoured parent pretty well defined
a watery and clouded moon
within the gate and lay
they moved away on their hands and
his breath crouching down again in
corner there and looking in he made
the three fishermen creeping
some rank grass and all the gravestones
the churchyard it was a large churchyard
they were in looking on like
in white while the church
itself looked on like the ghost
a monstrous giant they did
stood upright and then they began
fish they fished with a
at first presently the
parent appeared to be adjusting
instrument like a great corkscrew
tools they worked with they worked hard
the awful striking of the church
so terrified young jerry that he made
with his hair as stiff as his
s but his long
desire to know more about
matters not only stopped him in
again they were still fishing perseveringly when
the second time but now
seemed to have got a bite there
earth upon it and came
knew what it would be but when
new to the sight
stopped until he had run a mile
more he would not have stopped then
anything less necessary than
of race that he ran and
it was a pursuer to
it was an inconsistent and
fiend too for while
dreadful he darted out
the roadway to avoid dark alleys
a dropsical boy s kite without
and wings it hid
doorways too rubbing its horrible
against doors and drawing them up to
ears as if it were
it got into shadows on the road
lay cunningly on its back
trip him up all this time
his own door he had
for being half dead and even
it would not leave him but followed
on his breast when
fell asleep from his oppressed slumber
after daybreak and before sunrise by the
of his father in
family room something had
young jerry inferred from the
of his holding mrs cruncher by
the bed i told you i would
mr cruncher and i did
to the profit of the business
jerry and me and
try to be a good wife jerry
a good wife to oppose your
s business is it honouring your
to dishonour his business
of his business you hadn t
to the dreadful business then
a honest tradesman and not
he took to his trade
when he didn t a honouring
trade alone altogether call yourself a religious
if you re a religious
give me a irreligious one you
of duty than the
of this here thames river has of
pile and similarly it must be
into you the altercation was conducted in
terminated in the honest tradesman
kicking off his clay soiled boots and
down at his length on the floor
taking a timid peep at him
on his back with his rusty hands
his head for a pillow
son lay down too and fell asleep
cruncher was out of spirits
out of temper and kept an iron
lid by him as a projectile for
correction of mrs cruncher in
he should observe any symptoms of her
grace he was brushed and washed at
usual hour and set off with
son to pursue his ostensible calling
jerry walking with the stool under his
at his father s side along
and crowded fleet street was a
the previous night running
through darkness and solitude from

more than you can help to
at the present time

a mysterious dread of madame by which
all day at her counter so
unconscious of him and so
determined not to perceive that

wooden shoes whenever his eye lighted
that it was impossible to foresee
that lady might pretend next and he
assured that if she should take it
her brightly ornamented head to pretend
she had seen him
a murder and afterwards
go through with it until the play
the mender of roads
he was to find that

more for all that he can say
he knows of one eh well
madame defarge raising her eyebrows with a
been so careful to get it
that he then spelt it with perfect
name john john barsad
his appearance is it known age about
years height about five feet
peculiar inclination towards the left cheek expression
into the wine shop which was
for it was midnight
where madame defarge immediately took her
absence examined the stock went
the entries in the
made other entries of her own
the serving man in every possible way
out the contents of the
her handkerchief in a chain
separate knots for safe keeping through the
all this while defarge with his
in his mouth walked up
down complacently admiring but never
he walked up and down through
the night was hot
by so foul a neighbourhood was ill
monsieur defarge s olfactory sense was by
means delicate but the stock
wine smelt much stronger than it ever
and so did the stock of rum
brandy and aniseed he whiffed the compound
scents away as he put down his
out pipe you are fatigued said madame
money there are only
her husband acknowledged you are a
depressed too said madame whose
had had a ray or two for
oh the men the
but my dear began defarge
my dear you are faint of heart
night my dear well
said defarge as if a thought
long time repeated his
and when is it not
take a long time to
make and store the lightning
as if there were
a long time said madame for
earthquake to swallow a town eh well
long time i suppose said
place and grinds to
everything before it in the meantime
is always preparing though it
not seen or heard that
your consolation keep it she
a knot with flashing eyes as if
throttled a foe i tell
said madame extending her right
for emphasis that although
road it is on the
and coming i tell
stops i tell thee
all the world that we
world that we know consider
rage and discontent to
the jacquerie addresses itself
can such things last bah i
at his back like a docile
attentive pupil before his catechist i
possible that it may not
during our lives eh well how then
madame tying another knot
if there were another enemy strangled
half apologetic shrug we
not see the triumph we
her extended hand in strong action nothing
we do is done in
i believe with all
soul that we shall see the
but even if not
if i knew certainly not show me
neck of an aristocrat
cowardice i too my
will stop at nothing yes
it is your weakness that you sometimes
chained not shown yet always
madame enforced the conclusion
little counter with her chain of money
if she knocked its
out and then gathering the heavy handkerchief
her arm in a serene manner and
that it was time to go to
of her usual preoccupied air
standing or seated sprinkled about the
was very hot and heaps of flies
were extending their inquisitive and adventurous perquisitions
all the glutinous little
near madame fell dead
the bottom their decease made no impression
who looked at them
removed until they met the same
curious to consider how heedless flies
felt to be a
began to pin her rose in her
it was curious the moment
defarge took up the rose
customers ceased talking and began gradually to
monsieur she said it aloud but
to herself as she resumed her knitting
straight having a peculiar inclination towards
left cheek which imparts
sinister expression good day
and all have the goodness to give
a little glass of old cognac and
this madame it was the first time
and madame defarge knew enough of its
to know better she said however
the cognac was flattered and
up her knitting the visitor watched
in general you knit with great
madame i am accustomed
you think so said madame looking at
with a smile decidedly
one ask what it
for pastime said madame still looking
him with a smile while her
moved nimbly not for use
depends i may find
use for it one day if i
well said madame drawing a
stern kind of coquetry i ll
it it was remarkable but
decidedly opposed to a rose on the
dress of madame defarge two men
entered separately and had been about to
who was not there and
away nor of those who had been
when this visitor entered was
one left they had all dropped
open but had been
lounged away in a
stricken purposeless accidental manner quite natural and
her fingers knitted and her eyes
and i shall knit `barsad before
go you have a husband madame
is very bad the
are so poor ah the
as you say as
knitting an extra something into
name that boded him no good pardon
i and my husband have enough to
to keep this wine
here is how to
that is the subject we think of
it gives us from morning to night
to think about without embarrassing
heads concerning others i think for others
up any crumbs he could find
make did not allow his baffled state
express itself in his
face but stood with an
business this madame of gaspard s
a sigh of great compassion my faith
people use knives for
purposes they have to pay
it he knew beforehand
the price of his
was he has paid the price i
soft voice to a
that invited confidence and expressing
wicked face i believe there is
asked madame vacantly is
not here is my husband
wine shop entered at the door the
saluted him by touching his
and saying with an engaging
good day jacques defarge
jacques the spy repeated with
quite so much confidence or quite
deceive yourself monsieur returned
keeper of the wine shop you mistake
for another that is
my name i am ernest defarge it
all the same said the
airily but discomfited too good
to madame with whom i had the
that they tell me there is and
wonder much sympathy and anger
saint antoine touching the unhappy
of poor gaspard no
has told me so said defarge shaking
stood with his hand on the back
they were both opposed and whom
satisfaction the spy well used to
drained his little glass
cognac took a sip of fresh water
asked for another glass of
madame defarge poured it out for him
to her knitting again and
a little song over it you
to know this quarter
that is to say better than
recalls to me pursued the
that i have the honour of cherishing
defarge with much indifference
indeed when doctor manette was released
his old domestic had the charge
him i know he

the ringing of church bells

who sat knitting knitting that

glory on the quiet

evening when the doctor and
daughter sat under the plane tree together
did the moon rise with
night when it found them still seated
the tree and shone
their faces through its
tree you are happy my dear father
little though they had been there a
time when it was
light enough to work and read she
and many a time but this
was not quite like any other
nothing could make it
that heaven has so blessed
me but if my
were not to be
consecrated to you or
that it would part us even
the length of a few of these
i should be more unhappy and
not command her voice in the
moonlight she clasped him by the neck
laid her face upon his breast in
moonlight which is always sad as the
called human life is
dear can you tell me
last time that you feel

tenderly kissed her my future is far

and how plain it
my dear that it should be so
that your life should not be wasted

repeated the word wasted my child
how much my mind has
on this but only ask yourself
could my happiness be
while yours was incomplete if i
i should have been
happy with you he smiled at
unconscious admission that she would
been unhappy without charles having seen him

it had been no other i

i could draw across her at
full and the number of perpendicular

as he looked at the moon it
twenty either way i remember
the twentieth was difficult to squeeze
the strange thrill with which
heard him go back to that
there was nothing to

cheerfulness and felicity with the dire
that was over i

years of her age

that you had such thoughts of a
who never existed strikes to my
between us and the moon on
just now she knew
you so but on other moonlight nights
the sadness and the silence have
me in a different
like a sorrowful sense of peace
any emotion that had
for its foundations could
have imagined her as coming
me in my cell and leading me
have seen her image in the moonlight
except that i never held her
not the child i am speaking of
figure was not the the image
thing it stood before my disturbed sense
phantom that my mind pursued

these perplexed distinctions his
and calm manner could not

bestowed her on him by and bye
went into the house there
no one bidden to the marriage but
lorry there was even to be
was to make no change
their place of residence they had been
to extend it by taking
they desired nothing more doctor manette was
were only three at table
he regretted that charles was not there
him away and drank to
to bid lucie good night
third hour of the morning
came downstairs again and stole
were in their places all was
and he lay asleep his white hair
on the untroubled pillow and his hands
quiet on the coverlet she put
needless candle in the shadow
bed and put her lips
covered up their tracks with a
so strong that he held the
of them even in his sleep
more remarkable face in its quiet resolute
the wide dominions of sleep that
prayer that she might ever be as
and kissed his lips
more and went away
moved upon his face as softly
her lips had moved in
for him xviii nine days the marriage
ready outside the closed door
ready to go to
the beautiful bride mr lorry
miss pross to whom the
to the inevitable would
should have been the bridegroom and
not sufficiently admire the bride and
had been moving round
of her quiet pretty dress
so it was for this my sweet
i valued the obligation i was conferring
didn t mean it remarked the matter
mr lorry i am
crying said miss pross you are
to be pleasant with her
occasion you were just now
saw you do it and i don
wonder at it such a present
plate as you have made
is enough to bring
s not a fork or a spoon
the collection said miss pross that i
t cry over last night after
i am highly gratified said mr
had no intention of rendering those trifling
of remembrance invisible to
one dear me this is an occasion
makes a man speculate on all
has lost dear dear
to think that there might have
there never might have
pross you were a bachelor in your
well observed mr lorry beamingly adjusting
little wig that seems probable too
you were cut out
you were put in your cradle then
think said mr lorry that
selection of my pattern
room and miss pross and i
saying something to you that you
loving as your own he
be taken every conceivable
while you are in warwickshire and thereabouts
the wall comparatively speaking
him and when at the fortnight s
he comes to join
your other fortnight s trip
health and in the happiest frame now
to the door let me kiss
dear girl with an
comes to claim his
the forehead and then laid
bright golden hair against his little
wig with a genuine tenderness and delicacy
if such things be old
were as old as
the door of the doctor
room opened and he came
with charles darnay he was
deadly pale which had not been
case when they went in
that no vestige of colour
in the composure of his manner
shrewd glance of mr lorry
disclosed some shadowy indication that the old
of avoidance and dread had
cold wind he gave his
down stairs to the
which mr lorry had
in another carriage and soon
were happily married besides
glancing tears that shone among the
of the little group when
obscurity of one of mr lorry s
they returned home to
mingled with the poor shoemaker
mingled with them again
the morning sunlight on the threshold of
door at parting it was a hard
her father cheered her
said at last gently disengaging
to them from a
window and she was gone
corner being out of the way of
been very simple and
the doctor mr lorry and
was when they turned into the welcome
of the cool old hall that
lorry observed a great change to
come over the doctor as if the
him a poisoned blow he had naturally
expected in him when the occasion for
was gone but it was
of clasping his head and
wandering away into his
room when they got up
or at all disturb him i must
in at tellson s so i will
there at once and come
and all will be well it was
for mr lorry to look
at tellson s than to look
asked no question of the servant going
into the doctor s rooms
was stopped by a
sound of knocking good god
miss pross with a terrified face was
his ear o me o me
is lost cried she
and is making shoes
lorry said what he could
calm her and went
into the doctor s room the
was turned towards the light as it
shoemaker at his work before
his head was bent down and he
very busy doctor manette
dear friend doctor manette the doctor
at him for a moment
his work again he had laid
his coat and waistcoat his
used to be when he did
work and even the old haggard
surface of face had come back
him he worked hard
been interrupted mr lorry glanced at the
in his hand and observed that
shape he took up another
what it was a young lady s
finished long ago let it be
he obeyed in the old
proper occupation think dear friend nothing
induce him to speak more he looked
for an instant at a time
he was requested to
from him he worked and worked and
in silence and words fell
him as they would have fallen
an echoless wall or
the air the only
was that he sometimes furtively looked up
being asked in that
as though he were trying to reconcile
as important above all others the
that this must be kept
must be kept secret from
who knew him in conjunction with miss
by giving out that the doctor was
well and required a few days
to be practised on his daughter
pross was to write describing his having
to an imaginary letter of
these measures advisable to be taken in
case mr lorry took
the hope of his
that he thought the best on
doctor s case in
little appearance as possible
doing so he therefore made arrangements to
life and took his
by the window in the same room
was not long in discovering
it was worse than useless to
to him since on
reading and writing and expressing
as many pleasant and natural ways
he could think of that it
a free place doctor manette took
half an hour after mr lorry
or write when he put his
aside as useless until morning
lorry rose and said to him will
go out he looked down at the
on either side of him in the
manner looked up in the
voice out yes for a walk
effort to say why not and said
a word more but
in the dusk with
elbows on his knees and his head
his hands that he
in some misty way
intervals from the adjoining room he paced
and down for a long time before
did finally lay himself
he fell asleep in the
his bench and to
cheerfully by his name and spoke to
on topics that had been of late
to them he returned no reply but
what was said and
he thought about it however confusedly this
mr lorry to have
pross in with her work several times
the day at those
and of her father then
was done without any demonstrative accompaniment not
enough or often enough to harass
and it lightened mr lorry
friendly heart to believe that he looked
oftener and that he appeared to
stirred by some perception
inconsistencies surrounding him when it fell dark
before he repeated out yes for a
lorry feigned to go out when he
extract no answer from him and after
to the seat in
window and had sat
looking down at the
tree but on mr
s return he slipped away to
bench the time went very slowly
and his heart grew
again and grew yet heavier
came and went the fourth
seven days eight days nine
with a hope ever
and with a heart always growing
time the secret was well kept and
was unconscious and happy
he could not fail
hand had been a little
at first was growing dreadfully skilful
that he had never been so
had never been so nimble and
xix an opinion worn
by anxious watching mr lorry
asleep at his post on the
morning of his suspense
into the room where a heavy slumber
overtaken him when it was
but he doubted when he had done
whether he was not
asleep for going to the door of
doctor s room and looking
he perceived that the shoemaker s
and that the doctor
sat reading at the window he was
his usual morning dress and his
even when he had satisfied himself
he was awake mr
felt giddily uncertain for some few
whether the late shoemaking might not
own for did not his
accustomed clothing and aspect and employed
he had so strong
but the inquiry of
a real corresponding and sufficient
how came he jarvis lorry there how
the doctor s bedroom door in
miss pross stood whispering at his side
doubt left her talk
clear headed and had none he
that they should let
hour and should then
the doctor as if nothing unusual had
in his customary state
to seek direction and
miss pross submitting herself to his judgment
having abundance of time for his
methodical toilette mr lorry presented himself
the breakfast hour in his usual
the doctor was summoned in the
far as it was possible to comprehend
without overstepping those delicate and gradual
which mr lorry felt to be the
safe advance he at
supposed that his daughter s
of the week and the day of
month set him thinking
that mr lorry determined to have
aid he sought and
the breakfast was done
cleared away and he
the doctor were left together
lorry said feelingly my dear manette i
anxious to have your opinion in
say it is very curious
me perhaps to your better information
late work the doctor looked troubled and
hands more than once doctor manette said
the arm the case is the case
a particularly dear friend of
his sake and above
for his daughter s
saw that they understood one another and
my dear manette it
the case of an
express it the mind the
it is the case
a shock under which the
long because i believe he cannot calculate
means of getting at it it is
case of a shock from which the
recovered by a process
once heard him publicly relate in
a shock from which he has
so completely as to be a
intelligent man capable of close application of
and great exertion of body and of
making fresh additions to his stock
knowledge which was already very
but unfortunately there has been he
and took a deep
a slight relapse the
long duration nine days and nights
did it show itself i
glancing at his hands again in
resumption of some old
connected with the shock that
though in the same low voice
in that pursuit originally once
was he in most respects or in
all respects you spoke of his daughter
his daughter know of the relapse no
hope will always be kept from her
is known only to
and murmured that was very kind that
very thoughtful mr lorry
neither of the two spoke for a
mr lorry at length in
most considerate and most
way i am a mere man
business and unfit to
with such intricate and difficult matters
do not possess the kind of information
kind of intelligence i want guiding
how does this relapse
a repetition of it be prevented how
a repetition of it
treated how does it
do for my friend no man ever
have been more desirous
his heart to serve a
i knew how but i don t
how to originate in such a case
your sagacity knowledge and experience could
be able to do so much
and undirected i can do
little pray discuss it with me pray
a little more useful
manette sat meditating after these earnest
him i think it
said the doctor breaking silence with an
that the relapse you have
my dear friend was not quite
by its subject was it dreaded by
mr lorry ventured to ask
much he said it with an
an apprehension weighs on the sufferer s
and how difficult how almost impossible it
for him to force
to utter a word upon the topic
oppresses him would he asked mr
so but it is as i have
you next to impossible i even believe
hand on the doctor s arm
after a short silence on both
to what would you refer this
i believe returned doctor
that there had been a
and extraordinary revival of
train of thought and remembrance that
the first cause of
nature were vividly recalled
long been a dread lurking in
mind that those associations
be recalled say under
circumstances say on a
him less able to
it would he remember what
place in the relapse asked mr lorry
the room shook his
at all now as to the
great hope as it pleased
in its mercy to restore him
he yielding under the pressure of
complicated something long dreaded and
after the cloud had
the worst was over well well that
bending his head with reverence
are two other points
mr lorry on which
a better service the doctor gave him
hand to the first then he
not it may be
character of his mind to
always in singular need
occupation that may be in part natural
discovery you are sure that he
not under too great a strain i
i am quite sure of it
dear lorry i doubt if that
easily be there has been a violent
a counterweight excuse me as
persistent man of business assuming
a moment that he was overworked it
show itself in some renewal of
disorder i do not think so i
not think said doctor manette with the
of self conviction that anything but the
train of association would renew it
has happened and after
recovery i find it difficult to
that the circumstances likely to renew
are exhausted he spoke with the
of a man who knew how
confidence of a man who had slowly
his assurance out of
not for his friend to abate that
he professed himself more
point he felt it to be
remembering his old sunday morning conversation with
pross and remembering what he had
in the last nine
he knew that he must face it
occupation resumed under the influence
this passing affliction so happily recovered
said mr lorry clearing his throat
that he had been used in
bad time to work at a
is it not a
that he should keep it
him the doctor shaded his
with his hand and beat his foot
it by him said mr
with an anxious look at his friend
he should let it
forehead beat his foot nervously
the ground you do not find
lorry i quite understand it to be
nice question and yet
think and there he shook
head and stopped you
said doctor manette turning to him after
uneasy pause it is very hard to
consistently the innermost workings of this poor
for that occupation and it was
substituting the perplexity of
fingers for the perplexity of the
hands for the ingenuity of
mental torture that he has never been
when i believe he
more hopeful of himself
he has ever been and
speaks of himself with a kind
confidence the idea that he might need
it gives him a sudden sense
strikes to the heart
a lost child he
not mind i ask for
deals with such material objects
guineas shillings and bank notes may not
retention of the thing involve the retention
my dear manette might not the
go with it in
is it not a concession to the
to keep the forge there was another
you see too said the doctor
it is such an
it said mr lorry shaking his
for he gained in
i only want your authority
am sure it does no good come
man for his daughter s
within him in her name then let
be done i sanction it
was present let it be removed when
is not there let him miss his
companion after an absence
and the conference was
they passed the day in
country and the doctor was
restored on the three following
he remained perfectly well and
the fourteenth day he
precaution that had been taken
previously explained to him
he had written to lucie
accordance with it and she had no
he left the house mr lorry
into his room with a chopper saw
and hammer attended by miss pross carrying
light there with closed doors
in a mysterious and guilty
were assisting at a murder for which
unsuitable figure the burning of the
previously reduced to pieces convenient for
purpose was commenced without delay in
kitchen fire and the tools shoes and
so wicked do destruction and secrecy
to honest minds that mr lorry and
pross while engaged in the
of their deed and in
looked like accomplices in a horrible crime
a plea when the newly
to offer his congratulations was sydney
they had not been at home many
when he presented himself
was not improved in
but there was a certain
air of fidelity about him
was new to the observation of charles
he watched his opportunity of taking
of speaking to him when no
fashion of speech but
friends i scarcely mean quite that
charles darnay as was natural asked him
all good humour and good fellowship what
did mean upon my life said carton
to yours however let me try you
was more drunk than than usual i
for i always remember them
hope it may be
days are at an end for
am not going to preach
am not at all alarmed earnestness
you is anything but alarming to me
said carton with a
wave of his hand as if he
question one of a large
about liking you and
liking you i wish you would forget
i forgot it long
fashion of speech again but mr darnay
me as you represent it to
to you i have by no
answer does not help me
forget it if it
a light answer returned
i beg your forgiveness for
i had no other object than to
a slight thing which to my
seems to trouble you
much aside i declare
i have long dismissed it from my
i had nothing more important
me that day as
the great service said carton i am
to avow to you when you
was mere professional claptrap i
t know that i
it mind i say when i
returned darnay but i will not
with your light answer genuine truth mr
purpose i was speaking about
know i am incapable of
the higher and better flights of
ll tell you so
prefer to form my
opinion without the aid of
a dissolute dog who has never
any good and never will i
endure to have such
worthless fellow and a
of such indifferent reputation coming and
at odd times i should ask
go as a privileged person here
i might be regarded
for the resemblance i detected between
a hundred to one
times in a year it would
me i dare say
try that is another
placed on the footing
use that freedom with your name
they shook hands upon it and
gone and in the
miss pross the doctor and mr lorry
darnay made some mention of
conversation in general terms
a problem of carelessness
recklessness he spoke of him in
him but as anybody
had no idea that
fair young wife but
he afterwards joined her in their
rooms he found her
for him with the old
lifting of the forehead strongly
we are thoughtful to
hands on his breast and the
and attentive expression fixed upon
night what is it
lucie will you promise
i beg you not to ask it
not promise to my love
indeed with his hand putting aside the
hair from the cheek
his other hand against the
think charles poor mr carton deserves more
and respect than you expressed for him
what you are not to
me but i think i
he does if you know it
generous with him always and very
i would ask you
believe that he has a heart
very very seldom reveals and that
is a painful reflection to me
never thought this of him my husband
is reparable now but i am sure
he is capable of good things
beautiful in the purity
her husband could have looked at her
she was for hours and o
dearest love she urged
nearer to him laying
eyes to his remember how strong
are in our happiness and how
remember it dear heart
i live he bent over the
to his and folded her in
arms if one forlorn wanderer then
the dark streets could have heard her
disclosure and could have
the drops of pity kissed
by her husband from

lips for the first

sweet compassion xxi echoing
a wonderful corner for echoes it has
remarked that corner where
the golden thread which bound her husband
of quiet bliss lucie
in the still house in
the echoing footsteps of years
slowly fall from her hands
was something coming in
echoes something light afar off and
heart too much fluttering hopes
unknown to her doubts of her
upon earth to enjoy that
of footsteps at her own early grave
left so desolate and
would mourn for her so much swelled
passed and her little lucie

had once done often

awful sound as of

a dreadful sea rising
a night in mid july

down by lucie and
husband in the dark window it was
hot wild night and they
all three reminded of the old
night when they had looked at the

back that i should have to pass
business all day that we

a mania among some of
for sending it to england that

and we really can t be
out of the ordinary course

mr lorry patting her hand they are

evidently disappointed by the dialogue
held by the turnkey
their three heads had been close together
this brief discourse and it had been
much as they could
to hear one another even
so tremendous was the noise of

seven in number so fixedly

such like the loudly echoing

far out of her life for
years so long after the breaking of
cask at defarge s
only one exultant week in which to
his modicum of hard and bitter
fraternal embraces and congratulations when madame defarge
presiding over the customers
defarge wore no rose
her head for the great
of spies had become even
one short week extremely chary of
her arms folded sat in the
light and heat contemplating the wine shop
the street in both there
power enthroned on their
the raggedest nightcap awry on
significance in it i
how hard it has grown for me
but do you know how easy it
grown for me the wearer of this

the fingers of the
women were vicious with
change in the appearance of saint
last finishing blows had told mightily
the expression madame defarge sat observing it
such suppressed approval as was to

beside her the short
plump wife of a starved grocer and
had already earned the complimentary
of the vengeance hark
a train of powder laid
the outermost bound of saint antoine quarter
the wine shop door had
suddenly fired a fast
murmur came rushing along
is defarge said madame silence
defarge came in breathless pulled off a
cap he wore and
again listen to him defarge
panting against a background of
all those within the wine shop
sprung to their feet say
my husband what is it news
the other world how then
madame contemptuously the other world
everybody here recall old
who told the famished people that
might eat grass and who
he is among us
us from the universal throat again
so much and with reason that he

years and ten if he had
known it yet he would have

his wife looked steadfastly at
another the vengeance stooped
as she moved it at her feet
the counter patriots said
in a determined voice are we ready
madame defarge s knife was
beating in the streets as
by magic and the vengeance uttering
shrieks and flinging her arms
her head like all the
furies at once was tearing
house to house rousing the women
minded anger with which they looked from
caught up what arms they
sight to chill the boldest from such
occupations as their bare poverty
from their children from their

streaming hair urging one another and themselves
madness with the wildest cries and actions

into the midst of
beating their breasts tearing
hair and screaming foulon alive foulon

of the women lashed into blind frenzy
passionate swoon and were only saved by
men belonging to them from

flocked out of the quarter so fast

man ugly and wicked was and
streets the defarges husband
great distance from him in the
see cried madame pointing with her
a bunch of grass upon his back
under her arm and
her hands as at a play
people immediately behind madame defarge
the cause of her satisfaction to
the neighbouring streets resounded with the clapping
three hours of drawl and
impatience were taken up with marvellous quickness
a distance the more readily because
men who had by some wonderful exercise
agility climbed up the external architecture to
in from the windows knew madame defarge
and the crowd outside the building at
the sun rose so high
as of hope or protection directly down
favour was too much to
in an instant the
had stood surprisingly long went to the
and saint antoine had got him
was known directly to the furthest
of the crowd defarge had but sprung
a railing and a table and folded
and turned her hand in one
the vengeance and jacques three were not
up with them and the men
the windows had not yet swooped into
hall like birds of

bring him out bring

now on his back dragged and
by hundreds of hands torn
panting bleeding yet always entreating and beseeching
mercy now full of vehement agony of

the people drew one another back that
might see now a log of
him while they made ready and
he besought her the
passionately screeching at him all the
and the men sternly calling
to have him killed with grass
his mouth once he went aloft and
him shrieking twice he went aloft
the mouth for all saint antoine to
and danced his angry
bear foulon company set his head and
through the streets not
dark night did the men and
come back to the
and while they waited
stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the
by embracing one another on
ragged people shortened and
away and then poor lights began
shine in high windows
the streets at which neighbours cooked in
afterwards supping at their doors scanty
insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat
of most other sauce to wretched bread
the worst of the
played gently with their meagre children
it was almost morning

his poor ignorant soul and his
reduced body together the prison on

there were soldiers to guard it
not many there were officers to
what his men would
probably not be what
was ordered far and
lay a ruined country yielding nothing
was bowed down dejected oppressed and broken
fences domesticated animals men women

polite example of luxurious and shining
dry and squeezed out there must be
short sighted in the eternal arrangements
drop of blood having been
from the flints and the last
of the rack having been
so often that its purchase crumbled
bite monseigneur began to run away from
for scores of years
pleasures of the chase now found in
for whose preservation monseigneur made edifying
of barbarous and barren wilderness
the change consisted in the appearance of
faces of low caste rather than
the disappearance of the
caste chiselled and otherwise
not often troubling himself
reflect that dust he was and
in thinking how little he had
supper and how much
in these times as he raised his
prospect he would see some rough figure
on foot the like
which was once a rarity in
would discern without surprise that
was a shaggy haired man
almost barbarian aspect tall in
shoes that were clumsy even
grim rough swart steeped in
mud and dust of many
thorns and leaves and
of many byways through woods such a

dropped something into it
of the mender of roads to say
this time after observing these operations they
joined hands to night said the mender

directly as the road mender plied
clouds rolling away revealed bright bars and
little man who wore
of his blue one seemed fascinated by
figure on the heap
stones his eyes were
red cap the rough
dress of home spun stuff and hairy
of beasts the powerful frame attenuated by
living and the sullen
desperate compression of the
awe the traveller had travelled
chafed and bleeding his great

as he himself was into
stooping down beside him the road
or where not but in vain
he slept with his arms crossed upon
and set as resolutely as his
trenches and drawbridges seemed to the mender
roads to be so much air
against this figure and
he lifted his eyes from it
the horizon and looked around he
france the man slept
indifferent to showers of hail and
of brightness to sunshine on his face

leagues beyond the summit of

taken its poor supper it
not creep to bed as
usually did but came

with shrugs and biting of lips it

candles to be borrowed in

matter of course for
variety of reasons tellson s

well known to the public and
so numerous that tellson s sometimes wrote

charles darnay stood leaning on it
with the house was
it was within half an hour or
of the time of closing but
must still suggest to
i understand that i am
a long journey uncertain
that may not be even
for you my dear
said mr lorry with cheerful
away it is safe enough for
when there are so many
with as to its being a disorganised
disorganised city there would be no
to send somebody from our
the business of old and
uncertain travelling the long journey and the
weather if i were
prepared to submit myself
tellson s after all these
who ought to be
said charles darnay somewhat restlessly and
one thinking aloud indeed you are
pretty fellow to object and advise exclaimed
lorry you wish you were
yourself and you a frenchman born you
a wise counsellor my
mr lorry it is because i am
not mean to utter here however
help thinking having had some
for the miserable people and having
something to them he
might be listened to and might have
power to persuade to some restraint only
night after you had left us when
to lucie mr lorry repeated yes
mention the name of lucie
time of day however
with a smile it is
to the purpose that you say
are and i am in
reality the truth is my dear
house and lowered his
the difficulty with which our business
over yonder are involved the

time you know for who
say that paris is not
afire to day or sacked to morrow
a judicious selection from these with
getting of them out of harm s
is within the power without
of precious time of scarcely
i hang back when tellson s knows
and says this tellson s whose
i have eaten these sixty years
i am a little stiff about the
why i am a boy sir
half a dozen old
here how i admire the gallantry
your youthful spirit mr lorry tut nonsense

glancing at the house
getting things out of
what things is next
an impossibility papers and

to admit of delay and do you
no one with you all sorts
people have been proposed to me but
will have nothing to say to any
sunday nights for a long time

bull dog or of having any
must say again that i heartily
your gallantry and youthfulness i must
again nonsense nonsense when i have
this little commission i shall perhaps accept
taken place at mr lorry s
desk with monseigneur swarming
a yard or two of it boastful
what he would do to avenge himself
the rascal people before long

the skies that had
been sown as if nothing had ever
done or omitted to be
that had led to it as
observers of the wretched millions
it inevitably coming years
monseigneur for the restoration of

some remonstrance by any sane man who
the truth and it was such vapouring
about his ears like a troublesome
of blood in his own head
had already made charles
restless and which still kept
so among the talkers was stryver of
king s bench bar far

on the theme broaching to
exterminating them from the face of the

in their nature to the abolition of

darnay stood divided between going away that
to interpose his word when the

on to shape itself out the
had yet discovered any traces
the person to whom it was
the house laid the letter down so
to darnay that he saw

where this gentleman is to be
the hour of closing the
of talkers past mr lorry

of this plotting and indignant
and monseigneur looked at it in the
of that plotting and indignant refugee
this that and the other all had
disparaging to say in
in any case degenerate
murdered said one happy
say i never knew him
craven who abandoned his post
another this monseigneur had been
out of paris legs uppermost
half suffocated in a load
hay some years ago infected with the

roused to vigourous life by this
good one whose only crime
fidelity to himself and his

passersby he knew very well that in
suspicions of his uncle and in
aversion with which his conscience regarded
crumbling fabric that he was
to uphold he had
renunciation of his social place
incomplete he knew that
ought to have systematically worked it
and supervised it and
he had meant to
it and that it had
been done the happiness of his own
the time which had followed on one
so fast that the events of
week and the events
the week following made all new again
knew very well that to the force
disquiet but still without
times for a time

blotting out was as well known to

authority in france that might

gabelle had held the impoverished and involved
people to give them what little
was to give such fuel

had been that bad aims were being

stay bloodshed and assert the claims of

gentleman in whom duty was
strong upon that comparison injurious to himself
stung him bitterly and those of stryver
above all were coarse and galling
old reasons upon those had
of an innocent prisoner
danger of death to his justice
and good name his resolution was made
must sail on until he struck
knew of no rock he
hardly any danger the intention with which
done even although he had
aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in

mr lorry at parting
back charles darnay shook his head and
smiled as the carriage rolled away that
up late and wrote
fervent letters one was
lucie explaining the strong obligation
that he had for feeling
that he could become involved in no
doctor confiding lucie and their dear child
his care and dwelling on
same topics with the strongest
would despatch letters in
his arrival it was a
day that day of
among them with the
reservation of their joint lives on
mind it was a hard
to preserve the innocent deceit of

glance at his wife
happy and busy made
resolute not to tell her what impended
had been half moved to
it so strange it was to
to act in anything without her quiet
evening he embraced her and
scarcely less dear namesake pretending that
would return by and bye an imaginary
valise of clothes ready and
he emerged into the heavy mist of
heavy streets with a heavier heart
unseen force was drawing him fast
itself now and all the
and winds were setting
and strong towards it he

of the honour of
noble name was the poor prisoner

left all that was dear on

book book the third
track of a storm i
his way who fared towards
from england in the autumn
two more than enough
would have encountered to delay him though
fallen and unfortunate king of france had
upon his throne in all his
but the changed times were fraught with
obstacles than these every

their national muskets in
most explosive state of readiness who stopped

on or stopped them and

darnay began to perceive that
him along these country roads there
no hope of return until he should
been declared a good citizen at
whatever might befall now he
on to his journey s end not
not a common barrier
across the road behind him
he knew it to be another iron
in the series that was barred between
taken in a net or
being forwarded to his destination in a

and stopping him by anticipation riding
him and keeping him

upon his journey in
tired out in a little town on
paris nothing but the production of the
gabelle s letter from his prison
so far his difficulty at
guard house in this small place
been such that he felt
journey to have come to a

as a man could be
find himself awakened at the small inn
by a timid local
and with pipes in their mouths

house where other patriots in rough red
were smoking drinking and sleeping by

tri coloured cockades armed with

one of the patriots kept girded
his wrist in this state
their faces clattering at a heavy
trot over the uneven town pavement and
upon the mire deep roads in
except of horses and pace
the mire deep leagues that
between them and the capital they
in the night halting an hour or
escort were so wretchedly clothed that
twisted straw round their bare legs and
their ragged shoulders to keep the
off apart from the
danger as arose from one of the
being chronically drunk and carrying his musket
recklessly charles darnay did not allow
that it could have no
to the merits of an individual
that was not yet
and of representations confirmable by the
in the abbaye that
not yet made but when they came
the town of beauvais which they did
eventide when the streets were filled
people he could not
was very alarming an ominous crowd
to see him dismount of the
he stopped in the act
swinging himself out of his saddle
do you not see
here in france of my own
you are a cursed emigrant cried
a furious manner through the
aristocrat the postmaster interposed himself between this
and the rider s bridle
and soothingly said let him
the crowd roared approval checking the postmaster
was for turning his horse s
the line round his
darnay said as soon as
am not a traitor he lies cried
the decree his life is
to the people his cursed life is
his own at the instant when darnay
a rush in the eyes
would have brought upon him
postmaster turned his horse into
yard the escort rode
close upon his horse s flanks and
postmaster shut and barred the crazy double
the farrier struck a blow upon
with his hammer and the
groaned but no more was done
is this decree that the
spoke of darnay asked the postmaster when
had thanked him and stood beside him
the yard truly a decree for selling
fourteenth the day i left england
says it is but one of several
if there are not already banishing all
and condemning all to
who return that is what he
was not your own but
the postmaster shrugging his shoulders
may be or there
what would you have they rested on
the middle of the night and then
forward again when all the town
asleep among the many wild changes observable
unreal not the least was
seeming rarity of sleep after long
come to a cluster of
cottages not steeped in

ghostly manner in the dead of the

the untimely cold and
among impoverished fields that had yielded
fruits of the earth that
and by the sudden emergence from ambuscade
of paris the barrier
closed and strongly guarded when they rode
to it where are
man in authority who was summoned out
the guard naturally struck by the disagreeable
traveller and french citizen in charge
repeated the same personage without
any heed of him whatever
the drunken patriot had them
his eyes over gabelle s letter
some disorder and surprise and looked at
with a close attention he left
they sat upon their horses outside
state of suspense charles darnay observed that
gate was held by a mixed guard
soldiers and patriots the latter
outnumbering the former and that
ingress into the city for
carts bringing in supplies
for similar traffic and
was easy enough egress even for
of men and women
to mention beasts and
issue forth but the
identification was so strict
they filtered through the barrier
for examination to be so far
that they lay down on
ground to sleep or
cockade were universal both among men and
when he had sat
his saddle some half hour taking note
these things darnay found himself confronted by
to open the barrier then
delivered to the escort drunk and
a receipt for the
two patriots leading his tired horse
certain soldiers and patriots asleep and awake
sleeping and waking drunkenness and
were standing and lying about
light in the guard
half derived from the waning
lamps of the night and half from
overcast day was in
correspondingly uncertain condition some registers were
open on a desk
an officer of a coarse dark
presided over these citizen defarge said he
darnay s conductor as he
write on is this the
doubt where is your
law and for what offence the officer
up from his slip of paper for
appeal of a fellow countryman which lies
not that my right
have no rights evremonde was the
finished read over to himself what he
with the words in
defarge motioned with the
must accompany him the prisoner
a low voice as they
of doctor manette once a
is defarge and i keep
saint antoine possibly you have heard
me my wife came to your house
reclaim her father yes the
wife seemed to serve
a gloomy reminder to defarge to
with sudden impatience in the name
that sharp female newly born and
la guillotine why did you come to
you heard me say
a minute ago do you not
that i am absolutely lost will you
me a little help none
will you answer me
prison that i am

he therefore made haste to
it is of the utmost
better than i of how much importance
i should be able to
to mr lorry of
thrown into the prison of la force
you cause that to be done for
and the people i am
sworn servant of both against you i
do nothing for you charles darnay felt
hopeless to entreat him further and his
was touched besides as
not but see how
the people were to the spectacle
prisoners passing along the streets
him as an aristocrat otherwise that
prison was no more remarkable
that a labourer in working
should be going to work
one narrow dark and dirty
through which they passed an
orator mounted on a stool
against the people of
that he caught from this man
ambassadors had one and all left
had heard absolutely nothing the
and the universal watchfulness had completely isolated
that he had fallen among far
themselves when he left england he
course knew now that perils had thickened
him fast and might thicken
and faster yet he of course
now he could not
admit to himself that
might not have made this journey if
could have foreseen the events
a few days and yet his
future and in its obscurity there was
which within a few rounds of the
was to set a great mark of
upon the blessed garnering
his knowledge as if it had been
female newly born and called la
to the generality of people by
the frightful deeds that were to
doers how could they have
place in the shadowy conceptions
a gentle mind of unjust treatment in
and hardship and in cruel separation
his wife and child he
the likelihood or the certainty but beyond
he dreaded nothing distinctly with this on
mind which was enough to
into a dreary prison courtyard
arrived at the prison of la
a man with a bloated face
emigrant evremonde what the devil
many more of them exclaimed the
with the bloated face defarge took his
without noticing the exclamation
withdrew with his two fellow
what the devil i say again
the question merely replied one
who entered responsive to a
and one added for the
of liberty which sounded in
of la force was
a horrible smell of foul sleep in
imprisoned sleep becomes manifest in all
places that are ill
for in secret too grumbled the gaoler
at the written paper as if i
not already full to bursting
stuck the paper on a
in an ill humour and charles darnay
hour sometimes pacing to and fro
the strong arched room sometimes resting on
his keys come with me emigrant through
dismal prison twilight his new charge accompanied
by corridor and staircase many doors
and locking behind them until they
into a large low vaulted
crowded with prisoners of
sexes the women were seated
sewing and embroidering the men were
shameful crime and disgrace the
comer recoiled from this
but the crowning unreality of his long
every refinement of manner
the engaging graces and courtesies of life
manners and gloom so spectral
they become in the inappropriate
and misery through which they were
that charles darnay seemed to
in a company of the dead ghosts
of stateliness the ghost of elegance the
ghost of wit the ghost
their dismissal from the
motionless the gaoler standing at
side and the other
moving about who would have been well
as to appearance in
ordinary exercise of their functions
so extravagantly coarse contrasted
sorrowing mothers and blooming daughters
were there with the apparitions of the
the young beauty and the
woman delicately bred that the inversion of
shadows presented was heightened to its
surely ghosts all surely the
unreal ride some progress of disease
had brought him to these gloomy shades
and of condoling with you
us may it soon
happily it would be an impertinence elsewhere
as he could find but
hope said the gentleman following
are not in secret i do not
the meaning of the term but i
heard them say so
what a pity we so much
it but take courage several members
secret at first and it has lasted
voice i grieve to
the society in secret
was a murmur of commiseration as
grated door where the
of women were conspicuous gave him
wishes and encouragement he
at the grated door to
sight forever the wicket opened on a
staircase leading upward when they had
already counted them the gaoler
cold and damp but was
confined alone how do i know i
buy pen ink and paper such
not my orders you will be
you may buy your food
nothing more there were
a straw mattress as
gaoler made a general
of these objects and of the
fancy wandered through the mind of the
leaning against the wall opposite to him
this gaoler was so unwholesomely bloated both
face and person as to look
these crawling creatures is
five paces by four and
half the prisoner walked to
fro in his cell counting its measurement
muffled drums with a
shoes he made shoes he
shoes the prisoner counted the measurement again
paced faster to draw his mind
him from that latter repetition the ghosts
among them the appearance of
lady dressed in black who was
shining upon her golden hair and
looked like let us ride on
for god s sake
the illuminated villages with the people
made shoes he made shoes five
with such scraps tossing and rolling upward
the depths of his mind the prisoner
and the roar of the city changed
this extent that it still
in like muffled drums but with
wail of voices that he knew
paris was in a wing of a
a high wall and a strong
who had lived in it
he made a flight from the troubles
got across the borders a mere beast
the chase flying from hunters he was
in his metempsychosis no other
gone and the three strong
than ready and willing to cut his
fraternity or death monseigneur s house
been first sequestrated and then
fast and decree followed decree with
fierce precipitation that now upon
patriot emissaries of the law were
possession of monseigneur s
and had marked it with
state apartments a place of business in
would soon have driven the house out
seen on the ceiling in the
curtained alcove in the rear of
immortal boy and also of a
glass let into the wall and
old who danced in public
could get on with these things
well and as long
what plate and jewels would tarnish in
in prisons and when they
accounts with tellson s never to
that night any more than
jarvis lorry could though
thought heavily of these
he sat by a
year was prematurely cold and on his
and courageous face there was a deeper
or any object in the room distortedly
the bank in his fidelity to
house of which he
like strong root ivy
chanced that they derived a
of security from the patriotic occupation
him so that he did
duty on the opposite
carriages of monseigneur yet stood
two of the pillars
fastened two great flaring flambeaux
in the light of these
out in the open air was
large grindstone a roughly mounted
which appeared to have hurriedly been brought
from some neighbouring smithy or other workshop
and looking out of window at these
objects mr lorry shivered
retired to his seat by
his frame from the
the strong gate there
now and then an indescribable ring in
some unwonted sounds of
god said mr lorry clasping
hands that no one near
soon afterwards the bell at
great gate sounded and he thought they
come back and sat listening but
was no loud irruption
the courtyard as he had expected
he heard the gate clash
and all was quiet the nervousness and
that were upon him inspired that vague
respecting the bank which a great change
naturally awaken with such
roused it was well
his door suddenly opened and
which he fell back in
lucie and her father lucie with her
it had been stamped
to it in this
passage of her life what
confused what is the
lucie manette what has happened what has
you here what is it with the
fixed upon him in her
been here some days three or
t collect my thoughts
errand of generosity brought him here
to us he was stopped at
man uttered an irrepressible
voices came pouring into
courtyard what is that
said the doctor turning towards the
smile my dear friend i have a
have been a bastille prisoner there
no patriot in paris in paris
france who knowing me to have
a prisoner in the bastille
touch me except to overwhelm me
my old pain has given me a
that has brought us through
be so i knew
could help charles out of all danger
told lucie so what is that noise
hand was again upon the window don
look cried mr lorry absolutely desperate
her and held her don t
you that i know of no harm
happened to charles that i
no suspicion even of his
is he in la force la
lucie my child if ever
more depends upon it than
can think or i can
there is no help
you in any action on your part
night you cannot possibly stir out i
do for charles s sake is the
and quiet you must let
put you in a room
and me alone for
minutes and as there are life
not delay i will be submissive
you are true the
man kissed her and hurried
into his room and turned the
doctor and opened the window and
out upon a throng of men
women not enough in number
a convenient and retired spot but such
turning at it madly were
men whose faces as their long
the grindstone brought their faces up
visages of the wildest savages in their
barbarous disguise false eyebrows and false moustaches
countenances were all bloody and sweaty and
glaring with beastly excitement and
over their eyes now flung backward over
sparks struck out of the
all their wicked atmosphere
from the smear of
with the stain all over their
spoils of women s lace
stain dyeing those trifles through and
hatchets knives bayonets swords
brought to be sharpened were
hacked swords were tied to the
linen and fragments of dress ligatures various
kind but all deep
the one colour and as
frantic wielders of these
tore away into the streets the same
hue was red in their frenzied eyes
which any unbrutalised beholder would have
twenty years of life
petrify with a well directed gun
as the vision of
any very great pass
see a world if it were there
drew back from the window and
doctor looked for explanation in his friend
lorry whispered the words
you really have the
you think you have as i
hand hastened bareheaded out of the room
was in the courtyard when
impetuous confidence of his manner as he
the weapons aside like water carried him
of the concourse at the
pause and a hurry and a murmur
the unintelligible sound of
voice and then mr
saw him surrounded by all
in the midst of
line of twenty men long all linked
live the bastille prisoner help
the bastille prisoner s
in front there save the prisoner evremonde
la force and a thousand answering shouts
heart closed the window and the curtain
to lucie and told her
her father was assisted by the
to be surprised by their
until a long time afterwards
he sat watching them in such quiet
time fallen into a stupor on the
at his feet clinging
his hand miss pross had
her head had gradually fallen on
long long night with the
of the poor wife
no return of her
in the darkness the
the grindstone whirled and spluttered what is
lorry the place is
a kind of armoury my love twice
spell of work was
wounded soldier creeping back to
on a field of slain was
side of the grindstone and
worn out murderer descried in
imperfect light one of the carriages
monseigneur and staggering to
gorgeous vehicle climbed in
the door and shut himself up to
his rest on its dainty cushions
when mr lorry looked out again and
sun was red on the courtyard
the lesser grindstone stood alone
in the calm morning air
a red upon it
the sun had never given and
never take away iii the
one of the first considerations which arose
the business mind of mr
when business hours came round was
that he had no right
the wife of an emigrant prisoner
the bank roof his own
safety life he would have
for lucie and her child without a
was not his own and as
to defarge and he thought of finding
counsel with its master in reference to
safest dwelling place in the distracted
not returning and every minute
delay tending to compromise
of hiring a lodging for a
term in that quarter near the banking
as there was no business
to this and as he
that even if it were
well with charles and he
to be released he could not
lorry went out in
of such a lodging and found
suitable one high up in a
by street where the closed blinds
all the other windows of a high
removed lucie and her child and miss
giving them what comfort he
and much more than he had himself
left jerry with them as a figure
fill a doorway that would bear considerable
on the head and retained
he brought to bear upon
and slowly and heavily the day lagged
with him it wore itself
he was again alone in his room
the previous night considering what to do
stair in a few moments a
addressed him by his name your
said mr lorry do you
for answer he repeated without any change
emphasis the words do
know me i have seen
somewhere perhaps at my wine shop
said you come from
doctor manette and what says he what
he send me defarge
into his anxious hand
in the doctor s writing charles
a curiously reserved and
way defarge spoke mr lorry put on
hat and they went down into
courtyard there they found two women
had left her in exactly the
attitude some seventeen years ago it is
observed her husband does
seeing that she moved as they
the faces and know the
it is for their safety beginning to
looked dubiously at him
second woman being the vengeance they
through the intervening streets as quickly as
might ascended the staircase of
a transport by the tidings mr
gave her of her husband and
the hand that delivered
note little thinking what it had been
near him in the night and
him dearest take courage i
well and your father has
around me you cannot answer this
our child for me that was
the writing it was so much however
she turned from defarge to his wife
but the hand made no
dropped cold and heavy and took
something in its touch
the act of putting the
in her bosom and with her hands
at her neck looked terrified at madame
my dear said mr lorry striking in
ever trouble you madame defarge
to see those whom she has
power to protect at such
may know them that she may
them i believe said mr
rather halting in his reassuring words
the stony manner of all the
and more i state the
at his wife and gave no
answer than a gruff sound
acquiescence you had better lucie said mr
doing all he could to propitiate
tone and manner have
dear child here and our
pross our good pross defarge is an
was more than a match
any foreigner was not to be shaken
distress and danger appeared
folded arms and observed in english
boldface i hope you are pretty
madame defarge but neither
the two took much
of her is that his child
the first time and pointing her
needle at little lucie as if it
mr lorry this is our
shadow attendant on madame defarge and
party seemed to fall so
breast the shadow attendant on madame
child it is enough my husband
madame defarge i have seen
we may go but
suppressed manner had enough of menace in
hand on madame defarge s
you will be good to
poor husband you will
see him if you
your husband is not my business
returned madame defarge looking down at her
perfect composure it is the daughter of
father who is my business here for
sake then be merciful to my husband
my child s sake she will
of you than of these
madame defarge received it as
compliment and looked at her husband defarge
had been uneasily biting his thumb nail
a sterner expression what is it
your husband says in that little letter
madame defarge with a lowering
influence he says something
hurriedly taking the paper from
eyes on her questioner and
on it has much
release him said madame
me and not to exercise any
that you possess against my innocent
but to use it in his behalf
and mother madame defarge looked coldly
ever at the suppliant and said
to her friend the vengeance the
and mothers we have been used to
this child and much less have
husbands and fathers laid in prison
kept from them often enough all
lives we have seen
sister women suffer in themselves
in their children poverty nakedness hunger
sickness misery oppression and neglect of
kinds we have seen nothing else
the vengeance we have
turning her eyes again upon
trouble of one wife and mother would
much to us now she
her knitting and went out the
followed defarge went last and
the door courage my dear
said mr lorry as he raised
courage courage so far all goes well
it has of late gone
thankful heart i am not thankless
hope but that dreadful
and on all my hopes tut tut
a shadow indeed no substance
it lucie but the shadow of
manner of these defarges was dark upon
for all that and in
greatly iv calm in storm
manette did not return until
morning of the fourth
of his absence so much of what
happened in that dreadful time as
be kept from the knowledge of
was so well concealed from her that
until long afterwards when
of both sexes and all ages
that four days and nights had been
by this deed of horror
by the slain she only knew that
prisons that all political prisoners had been
danger and that some had been
murdered to mr lorry the doctor
under an injunction of secrecy on which
had no need to
through a scene of carnage to the
of la force that in
prison he had found a self appointed
sitting before which the prisoners were
be sent back to their cells that
by his conductors to this tribunal
had announced himself by name
profession as having been for
years a secret and unaccused
in the bastille that one of
identified him and that
man was defarge that hereupon he
of whom some members were asleep
first frantic greetings lavished
himself as a notable
under the overthrown system it had been
in his favour met with
unexplained check not intelligible
the doctor which led to
few words of secret conference that the
sitting as president had then informed
manette that the prisoner
be held inviolate in safe custody that
on a signal the prisoner was removed
the interior of the prison again but
he the doctor had then so strongly
for permission to remain
law was through no malice or
delivered to the concourse whose
yells outside the gate had often
permission and had remained in
hall of blood until the danger
with brief snatches of food and sleep
intervals shall remain untold the mad
over the prisoners who
mad ferocity against those who
cut to pieces one prisoner
been discharged into the
free but at whom a
savage had thrust a pike
he passed out being besought to
the doctor had passed out
the same gate and
found him in the
of a company of samaritans
were seated on the bodies
anything in this awful nightmare
had helped the healer and tended the
man with the gentlest solicitude
carefully from the spot had then caught
their weapons and plunged anew
midst of it as
watched the face of his friend now
misgiving arose within him
such dread experiences would revive the old
but he had never
he had never at all
that his suffering was strength and
for the first time he
that in that sharp
he had slowly forged the iron
of his daughter s husband and
him it all tended to a
now in restoring the dearest part of
to her by the aid of heaven
jarvis lorry saw the kindled eyes the
of the man whose life
seemed to him to have been stopped
a clock for so
years and then set going again
dormant during the cessation of
usefulness he believed greater things than
doctor had at that
to contend with would
yielded before his persevering purpose while
kept himself in his place
a physician whose business
with all degrees of mankind bond
free rich and poor
and good he used his personal
so wisely that he was
the inspecting physician of three prisons and
them of la force he could
assure lucie that her
with the general body
lips sometimes her husband himself sent a
to write to him
among the many wild
of plots in the prisons the wildest
were known to have made
or permanent connections abroad this new
of the doctor s was
anxious life no doubt still
was a new sustaining
it was a natural and worthy one
he observed it as a curiosity
minds of his daughter and his
with his personal affliction deprivation and weakness
that this was changed and he
trial with forces to which
both looked for charles s ultimate
and deliverance he became so far
by the change that
took the lead and direction
required them as the weak to
to him as the
the preceding relative positions of
and lucie were reversed yet
as the liveliest gratitude
have had no pride but in rendering
service to her who
lorry in his amiably shrewd way
all natural and right so take
it it couldn t be in better
but though the doctor tried hard and
to get him brought to trial the
current of the time set too
and fast for him the new era
the king was tried doomed
beheaded the republic of liberty
flag waved night and
rose from all the
soils of france as if the dragon
hill and plain on
in gravel and alluvial mud
in fell and forest in the
and the olive grounds
among the cropped grass and the
the broad rivers and in the
of liberty the deluge rising from below

and nights circled as regularly
when time was young and the evening
morning were the first day other

day among these terrors and the brood
to them the doctor walked
persistent in his end never doubting that
would save lucie s husband at last

miss pross threaded her way along the
streets and crossed the
by the bridge of
purchases she had to make
cruncher with the basket walked at
side they both looked to
into most of the shops they
had a wary eye for all gregarious
and the misty river blurred to the
with blazing lights and to the ear
smiths worked making guns for the army
the republic woe to the
who played tricks with
army or got undeserved promotion in
him close having purchased a few
for the lamp miss pross bethought
of the wine they wanted
she stopped at the sign
antiquity not far from the national palace
and twice the tuileries where the aspect
things rather took her fancy
had a quieter look than any
place of the same description they
passed and though red with
caps was not so red

climax by the disciples of the
republican brutus of antiquity except
it was something very voluble
loud would have been as so
her protector though they had
ears for anything in their surprise
miss pross lost in amazement and
but mr cruncher though

no affection there confound
there said solomon making a dab at
pross s lips with

rendered suspected by my own
far rather would i
see you again dear solomon though
have ever loved you truly
or estranged between us and i
detain you no longer good miss
as if the estrangement between them
if mr lorry had
known it for a fact years ago
that this precious brother
grudging condescension and patronage than he
have shown if their relative merits
positions had been reversed which
invariably the case all the world
when mr cruncher touching
on the shoulder hoarsely and unexpectedly
with the following singular question i say
i ask the favour as to
your name is john solomon
solomon john the official turned towards
come said mr cruncher speak out you
which by the way was
solomon and she must know being

speaker who struck in was sydney

miss pross i arrived

sheep was a cant word of the
and asked him how
dared i ll tell you
of the conciergerie while

you in that connection
having a reason to which you
no stranger for associating you with
walked in your direction i walked into
and sat near you
had no difficulty in
from your unreserved conversation and
rumour openly going about among your admirers
nature of your calling and gradually
shape itself into a purpose mr barsad
troublesome and might be
to explain in the
at the office of tellson
bank for instance under a

you apprehend me very
s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully

come come mr barsad exclaimed sydney don

then miss pross recalled soon afterwards
to the end of her life remembered
as she pressed her hands on
face imploring him to
no hurt to solomon there was
braced purpose in the
light manner but changed and
the man she was too
occupied then with fears for the brother
so little deserved her affection and
sydney s friendly reassurances
to heed what she observed
left her at the corner
pross walked at his side mr lorry
just finished his dinner and was
or two of fire perhaps
into their blaze for the picture
coals at the royal
years ago he turned his head
they entered and showed the
with which he saw
stranger miss pross s brother sir
old gentleman barsad i
an association with the name and with
face i told you you had

by saying to him
a frown witness at that

his new visitor with
undisguised look of abhorrence mr

gentleman exclaimed what do you tell
i left him safe and free
these two hours and am about

barsad just now if at all
barsad is the best authority
sir said sydney and i have it

when we remember how

mr lorry acknowledged with
troubled hand at his chin and
troubled eyes on carton
short said sydney this

man s life here

people to day may be condemned
now the stake i have resolved to
for in case of the worst is
friend in the conciergerie and the
sir said the spy i ll run

a brute i am
off a glassful drank off another glassful
the bottle thoughtfully away
barsad he went on in the tone
the prisons emissary of
the more valuable here for
those characters than a
false name that s
employ of the republican french government was
in the employ of the aristocratic english
the enemy of france
as day in this
of suspicion that mr barsad still
the pay of the

traitor and agent of

mr barsad not to
your play returned the spy
denunciation of mr barsad
you have don t hurry he
glassful of brandy and drank
off he saw that the spy
fit state for the
denunciation of him seeing it he poured
and drank another glassful look
your hand carefully mr barsad take
it was a poorer hand than he
that sydney carton knew
of thrown out of
honourable employment in england through too
because he was not wanted there
english reasons for vaunting
superiority to secrecy and spies
of very modern date he
that he had crossed
channel and accepted service in france first
a tempter and an eavesdropper
his own countrymen there gradually as a
and an eavesdropper among the natives he
that under the overthrown

concerning doctor manette s
release and history as should serve him
an introduction to familiar conversation with the
broken down with them
that terrible woman had knitted when
talked with her and had
antoine over and over again produce her
registers and denounce people whose lives the
one employed as he was did that
was never safe that
tied fast under the
of the axe and that
denounced and on such
grounds as had just now
that the dreadful woman of
unrelenting character he had seen
terrified here were surely
enough of one black suit to
the holder in growing
scarcely seem to like your
said sydney with the greatest
meanest manner as he
to his station to play
a discreditable station though
must be filled by somebody
make himself one i
my ace mr barsad said carton taking
answer on himself and
at his watch without any
in a very few minutes i
that your respect for my sister i

rough dress and probably with his usual
received such a check from the inscrutability

that i have another

adieu mr barsad said the
our arrangement thus made you have nothing

what he had done not much
it should go ill with the prisoner

said nothing worse could happen to him
he were denounced it was obviously
if it should go
before the tribunal will not save
i never said it
mr lorry s eyes
disappointment of his second
gradually weakened them he was an
his tears fell you are a good
an altered voice forgive me if
could not see my father weep and
his usual manner there
a true feeling and respect both in
tone and in his touch
for he gave him his hand
carton gently pressed it to
to poor darnay said

enable her to go
see him she might think it
thought of that and he looked
at carton to see if
to be he returned the
might think a thousand things

you when i first came i had
not see her i can put my
out to do any little helpful
for her that my
must be very desolate
night i am going now directly
and reliance on you
does she look anxious and unhappy but
beautiful ah it was
almost like a sob
attracted mr lorry s eyes
carton s face which was
to the fire a light
a shade the old gentleman could not
said which passed from it
swiftly as a change will
over a hill side on a wild
back one of the little flaming logs
white riding coat and
of the fire touching their
surfaces made him look
pale with his long brown hair all
hanging loose about him his indifference to
a word of remonstrance from
lorry his boot was still
the hot embers of the
log when it had broken under
he said mr lorry s eyes
the wasted air which clouded the
handsome features and having the expression
prisoners faces fresh in his
he was strongly reminded of
expression and your duties
as i was telling
i have at length done
that i can do here i hoped
to pass i was ready to go
were both silent yours is a
sir said carton wistfully i am
my seventy eighth year

man of business ever since i

man of business when a

seventy eight how many
will miss you when you leave
empty a solitary old bachelor

thank god i didn t
mean what i said it is a
to thank god for

your own solitary heart to night i
secured to myself the love and
the gratitude or respect
no human creature i have
myself a tender place
good or serviceable to be remembered by
seventy eight heavy curses would they
again upon the fire
after a silence of
few moments said i
far off do the days when
sat at your mother s
and closer to the end
and nearer to the beginning it seems
preparings of the way
remembrances that had long
asleep of my pretty
mother and i so old and
with me and my faults were
confirmed in me i
the feeling exclaimed carton with a bright
it i hope so carton terminated
conversation here by rising to help him
with his outer coat but
said mr lorry reverting to
my young way was never the way
i am sure said mr lorry are
going out i ll walk with you
her gate you know my vagabond and
habits if i should prowl
the streets a long time
in the morning you
to the court to morrow yes
i shall be there but only
one of the crowd my
will find a place for me
my arm sir mr lorry did
in the streets a few minutes brought
to mr lorry s
carton left him there but lingered at
little distance and turned
heard of her going to
prison every day she came out here
said looking about him turned this way
let me follow in her
it was ten o

his shop was smoking
pipe at his shop
good night citizen said sydney carton
in going by for the man

little man persisted calling after him and
a pipe with you sydney had

step of one who

and dirty streets much dirtier than

at a chemist s shop which the
tortuous up hill thoroughfare by a
too good night as
whew the chemist whistled
as he read it hi
mixing them perfectly certain small packets
made and given to
deliberately left the shop
is nothing more to do
he glancing upward at the moon
fast sailing clouds nor was it more
of negligence than defiance it
he had been famous among his
competitors as a youth of great
these solemn words which had been read
his father s grave arose in
mind as he went
the dark streets among the heavy
the resurrection and the life saith
me though he were dead
liveth and believeth in me shall
die in a city dominated by
axe alone at night with
the sixty three who had been
doom in the prisons
still of to morrow s and to
s the chain of association that
the words home like a rusty old
s anchor from the deep might have
interest in the lighted
through a few calm hours
the horrors surrounding them in the towers
the churches where no prayers were
for the popular revulsion had even
burial places reserved as
wrote upon the gates for eternal
in the abounding gaols and in
streets along which the sixties rolled
a death which had become so
and material that no
ever arose among the people
with a solemn interest in
down to its short nightly pause
for the lighter streets
coaches were liable to be suspected and
put on heavy shoes and trudged
people poured cheerfully out as
passed and went chatting home at
little girl with a mother looking
a way across the street through
mud he carried the
over and before the timid arm
loosed from his neck asked her for
kiss i am the resurrection and the
saith the lord he that
in me though he
dead yet shall he live and whosoever
and believeth in me shall
and the night wore
echoes of his feet and were in
he heard them always
upon the bridge listening to the
as it splashed the river walls
of houses and cathedral shone bright in
with the moon and the stars turned
and died and for a
were delivered over to death s dominion
to strike those words
his heart in its long bright
shaded eyes a bridge of light appeared
and the sun while the river sparkled
it the strong tide so swift so
and certain was like
congenial friend in the morning
the houses and in
light and warmth of the sun fell
on the bank when
awoke and was afoot again he lingered
yet a little longer watching
the stream absorbed it and
it on to the sea like
a trading boat with a sail
then glided into his
silent track in the water disappeared
prayer that had broken up out of
heart for a merciful consideration of
old man was gone
carton drank nothing but a
coffee ate some bread
having washed and changed

out at the window and
and the same voice called to

to open the door

both wrapped in cloaks and
to conceal themselves as
stood side by side near the carriage
i also observed that they both looked
that they were greatly alike
am `doctor manette formerly of beauvais
the other `the young physician originally
expert surgeon who within the last

reputation in paris `gentlemen i
you speak so graciously

estimate the distance at that
but afterwards when i traversed it
presently stopped at a solitary house
all three alighted and walked by
a neglected fountain had overflowed to
door of the house it was

man who opened it
his heavy riding glove across
action to attract my particular attention for
had seen common people struck more
than dogs but the
look and bearing of the brothers were
so exactly alike that i
first perceived them to be twin
the outer gate which we found
had opened to admit us and had
from an upper chamber i
the cries growing louder as
ascended the stairs and
found a patient in
high fever of the brain lying on
woman of great beauty
her hair was torn and ragged
which was a fringed scarf for
dress of ceremony i saw the
bearings of a noble and
first minute of my contemplation
the patient for in
on her face on the
of the bed had drawn
end of the scarf
her mouth and was in
out my hand to relieve her breathing
in moving the scarf
the embroidery in the corner caught
sight i turned her gently over placed
hands upon her breast to
and repeated the words `my husband my
and my brother and then counted
an instant and no more
my brother and would
up to twelve and say
there was no variation in the

the younger by the elder i
about this hour last night

recently occupied and temporarily used some
windows to deaden the sound of
shrieks they continued to be uttered

mirror and slightly altered the disordered
of his loose cravat and
be no customer in the
whom he had seen upon the
counter in conversation with the defarges man
establishment as carton walked in took his
and asked in very
french for a small measure
wine madame defarge cast a careless glance
him and then a keener
then a keener and
advanced to him herself and asked him
asked madame defarge inquisitively
her dark eyebrows after looking at
as if the sound of even
single french word were slow to express
to him he answered in his former
foreign accent yes madame yes i
english madame defarge returned to her
to get the wine and as he
up a jacobin journal and feigned to
to you like evremonde defarge brought
good evening how good
oh good evening citizen

madame sternly retorted i tell you a
deal like jacques three pacifically remarked

you madame the amiable
looking forward with so
pleasure to seeing him once
lines and words of
paper with a slow forefinger and
a silence of a
moments during which they
looked towards him without disturbing his outward
from the jacobin editor they resumed their
jacques three why stop there is
force in that why
one must stop somewhere after all the

the vengeance also highly approved extermination
troubled in general i say nothing

looking up at the

in number as the weeks of
year fifty two were to roll that
city to the boundless everlasting sea
their cells were quit of

the tribunal in every

to compose his mind
hard to loosen by gradual
and degrees unclosed a little here
brought his strength to

he did feel resigned then his
and child who had to live after
it a selfish thing but all
consideration that there was no
in the fate he must meet and
numbers went the same
wrongfully and trod it firmly every day
calmed into the better state when he
raise his thoughts much
and draw comfort down before
had set in dark
he had travelled thus far on his
he sat down to write until such
as the prison lamps
be extinguished he wrote a long letter
lucie showing her that he
known nothing of her
s imprisonment until he had heard of
from herself and that he had been
father s and uncle s responsibility
that misery until the paper had been
he had already explained to her that
concealment from herself of
name he had relinquished was the one
fully intelligible now that her father had

promise he had still exacted on
her father had become oblivious of the
of the paper or had

justly reproach himself but
next to her preservation
his own last grateful love and blessing
her overcoming of her
to devote herself to their dear
he adjured her as they would meet
her father himself he wrote
told her father that
expressly confided his wife and
to his care and he told
this very strongly with the hope of
him from any despondency

and explained his worldly affairs that done

and she told him it was
a dream and he had never gone
he had even suffered and
come back to her dead and at
difference in him another
come through the hours to the
when the fifty two heads were
end with quiet heroism
new action began in
waking thoughts which was very difficult to
way his face would
or might be the last
and many similar questions in nowise
they connected with fear he was conscious
no fear rather they originated in
strange besetting desire to know
came a desire gigantically disproportionate to the
swift moments to which it referred
wondering that was more like
wondering of some other
within his than his own the
went on as he walked to
fro and the clocks struck the numbers
for ever twelve coming on
had got the better of
he walked up and down softly
strife was over he
walk up and down
from distracting fancies praying
himself and for them twelve gone
ever he had been apprised that
knew he would be summoned
time earlier inasmuch as the tumbrils jolted
and slowly through the

two before his mind as the hour
so to strengthen himself in the interval
he might be able after
time to strengthen others walking
his breast a very different man
the prisoner who had walked to and
at la force he heard one struck
and turned to walk again footsteps in
stone passage outside the
he stopped the key
time the door was quickly
and closed and there stood
him face to face quiet intent upon
with the light of
smile on his features and
cautionary finger on his lip
carton there was something
bright and remarkable in his
that for the first moment
prisoner misdoubted him to
an apparition of his own
voice he took the prisoner s

few words more he dictated again `i
thankful that the time

or grief as he
slowly and softly moved

on the table and he looked about
asked vapour something that crossed me
finish hurry hurry as if
faculties disordered the prisoner made an
carton with clouded eyes and with an
manner of breathing carton his hand
him hurry hurry the
bent over the paper once more `if
had been otherwise carton
hand was again watchfully and softly stealing
longer opportunity if it had been otherwise
hand was at the prisoner s face
should but have had

carton looked at the pen and saw
was trailing off into unintelligible signs carton
hand moved back to his breast
more the prisoner sprang up with
and carton s left arm
a few seconds he faintly struggled with
man who had come
lay down his life
him but within a minute or so
carton dressed himself in
clothes the prisoner had laid
combed back his hair and
it with the ribbon the prisoner
there come in and the spy presented
you see said carton looking up
beside the insensible figure putting the
hazard very great mr
the spy answered with a timid
of his fingers my

at the table resting his forehead

be careful of my
i entreat you and leave me come
my children said barsad lift him and
away the door closed and
powers of listening to the utmost he
for any sound that might
suspicion or alarm there was
raised or hurry made that
he sat down at the table and
again until the clock
succession and finally his own
gaoler with a list in his hand
and he followed into a
dark room at a distance it was
with the shadows without he could
dimly discern the others who were brought
to have their arms
lamenting and in restless
but these were few the great
the ground as he stood
the wall in a dim corner
some of the fifty two were brought
after him one man stopped
a knowledge of him
thrilled him with a great dread of
a young woman with
slight girlish form a sweet
colour and large widely opened patient
rose from the seat where he
him citizen evremonde she
touching him with her cold hand i
in la force he
poor little weak creature like me the
smile with which she said it
touched him that tears started
afraid to die citizen evremonde but i
die if the republic
my death but i do not
how that can be citizen evremonde such
the last thing on
that his heart was to
true it was but
was again taken and
lifted to his face he saw
sudden doubt in them
then astonishment he pressed the
his lips are you dying for him
hold your brave hand stranger hush
same shadows that are falling on the
the barrier with the
whom have we within papers

these are again the
is terror in the carriage there
lucie clinging to the old man it
i must not urge them
look back and see
we are pursued the road
twos and threes pass
us solitary farms ruinous buildings dye works
and the like open country
ruts and sloughs there
great that in our wild alarm and
we are for getting
and running hiding doing anything but stopping
of the open country
tanneries and the like
in twos and threes
us and taken us back
twice over thank heaven no a village
back look back and see
the coach stands in
little street bereft of horses and with
likelihood upon it of ever moving
leisurely the new horses
plaiting the lashes of
whips leisurely the old postilions
their money make wrong
and arrive at dissatisfied results all
beating at a rate that would far
the fastest gallop of
fastest horses ever foaled at length the
postilions are in their saddles
the old are left behind
are through the village
the hill and down the
and on the low watery grounds
the postilions exchange speech
animated gesticulation and the horses are
are pursued ho within the carriage
speak then what is
how many did they
i do not understand you at the
post how many to the guillotine
day fifty two i said so a
number my fellow citizen here
whoop the night comes
he asks him by his name
look out look out and see
we are pursued the wind is rushing
us and the clouds are flying after
and the moon is plunging after
juncture of time when the fifty
council with the vengeance and
three of the revolutionary jury not in
the wood sawyer erst
not participate in the conference but abided
a little distance like
outer satellite who was not to speak
required or to offer an
until invited but our defarge said
shrill notes in france peace little
said madame defarge laying her hand with
slight frown on her lieutenant
lips hear me speak my
bold man he has deserved well of
but my husband has his weaknesses and
with his cruel fingers at his hungry
a good citizen it is a
doctor i he may wear
head or lose it for any
i have in him it is all
to me but the evremonde
are to be exterminated and the wife
has a fine head for
blue eyes and golden hair
and they looked charming when samson
like an epicure madame
cast down her eyes and reflected
little the child also
sight in a word said madame
i cannot trust my husband in this
not only do i
since last night that i dare
i delay there is
they might escape that must never be
jacques three no one
it is we ought to have
not my reason for pursuing this
doctor with any sensibility

come hither little citizen the wood sawyer
held her in the
advanced with his hand to his red
touching those signals little citizen said madame
sternly that she made to the
you are ready to bear witness
why not cried the sawyer every
in all weathers from
to four always signalling
with the little one sometimes without
know what i know i have
with my eyes he made all
of gestures while he
as if in incidental imitation of some
of the great diversity
signals that he had never
clearly plots said jacques three transparently there
no doubt of the jury inquired madame
gloomy smile rely upon the patriotic
now let me see said
defarge pondering again yet
three in a low voice we
have not heads enough it
be a pity i think he was
silent and trust the case wholly
him this little citizen here for
am not a bad witness the
was the most admirable and
be outdone declared her to be a
said madame defarge no i
spare him you are engaged at
the batch of to day executed
the question was addressed to the wood
the most ardent of
if anything prevented him from enjoying the
of smoking his afternoon pipe in
contemplation of the droll
barber he was so very demonstrative
that he might have been
perhaps was by the
eyes that looked contemptuously at him
day i said madame am equally
at the same place after
to night come you to me in
people at my section the wood
a small dog would have done retreated
his wood and hid his confusion over
handle of his saw madame defarge beckoned
little nearer to the door and there
she will now be at home awaiting
be mourning and grieving she
be in a state of mind
be full of sympathy with its
ah my cherished cried the
have it ready for me in my
seat keep me my usual chair go
there straight for there will
usual to day i
obey the orders of my chief
her cheek you will
be late i shall be there before
commencement and before the
arrive be sure you are there my
said the vengeance calling after her
defarge slightly waved her
to imply that she
good time and so went through
mud and round the corner
the prison wall the
and the juryman looking
her as she walked
were highly appreciative of her fine
many women at that time
whom the time laid a
one among them more to be dreaded
way along the streets
a strong and fearless
of shrewd sense and readiness of great
seems to impart to its possessor firmness
others an instinctive recognition of those qualities
but imbued from her childhood
a brooding sense of
and an inveterate hatred of a class
had developed her into a tigress
had the virtue in
her that an innocent
was to die for the sins of
them it was nothing to her
his wife was to be made a
such had no right to live to
to her was made hopeless by her
no sense of pity
been laid low in the
in any of the many encounters
been ordered to the axe to
would she have gone to
heart madame defarge carried under her rough
carelessly worn it was a becoming
her dark hair looked
under her coarse red cap
hidden in her bosom
her waist was a sharpened dagger
accoutred and walking with
the supple freedom of a
who had habitually walked in her
brown sea sand madame defarge
her way along the streets now
at that very moment waiting for the
planned out last night the
of taking miss pross in
it was not merely
but it was of the highest
examining it and its passengers
their escape might depend
the saving of only a few
here and there finally
miss pross and jerry who were at
three o clock in the
wheeled conveyance known to that period unencumbered
luggage they would soon overtake the coach
passing it and preceding it on
of the night when delay was
solomon brought had passed some ten
in tortures of suspense and were now
even as madame defarge taking her
through the streets now drew nearer and
which they held their consultation now what
whose agitation was so
that she could hardly
or stand or move or live what
starting from this courtyard
carriage having already gone
returned mr cruncher is as you
right likewise wot i ll stand by
right or wrong i am
distracted with fear and hope for our
creatures said miss pross wildly crying that
am incapable of forming
plan are you capable of forming
respectin a future spear
life miss returned mr cruncher i
so respectin any present use o this
blessed old head o
i think not would you do me
promises and wows wot it is my
crisis oh for gracious sake
miss pross still wildly crying record
at once and get them
of the way like an excellent man
said mr cruncher who was all in
solemn visage them poor
that you never will do
again whatever it is and i
more particularly what it
named to you second them poor
well out o this and never no
may be said miss pross
compose herself i have no doubt it
it entirely under her own superintendence
as to say miss
proceeded mr cruncher with
most alarming tendency to hold
to mrs cruncher through yourself that wot
opinions respectin flopping has undergone
hope with all my heart
flopping at the present time there
there i hope she is my dear
cried the distracted miss
additional tendency to hold forth and
said or done should be
we shouldn t all flop if
a protracted but vain
to find a better one and
madame defarge pursuing her way
my telling mrs cruncher
impressively said and at all events
think my esteemed mr
let us think still madame defarge
her way along the streets
nearer and nearer if you were
go before said miss pross and
were to wait somewhere for me
t that be best mr
you wait for me asked
alas temple bar was hundreds
miles away and madame defarge was drawing
miss pross would it be much
of the way to
me in near the
cathedral door between the two towers
miss answered mr cruncher then like the
t returned miss pross
have no fear for
o clock or as near
as you can and i am
it will be better
cruncher think not of me
of the lives that
depend on both of us
exordium and miss pross s two hands
quite agonised entreaty clasping his decided
the arrangements and left
by herself to follow as
had proposed the having originated
precaution which was already
course of execution was a great
it should attract no special notice
the streets was another relief she looked
to lose but must get
at once afraid in her extreme perturbation
the loneliness of the deserted rooms
of half imagined faces peeping from behind
open door in them
pross got a basin
eyes which were swollen
red haunted by her feverish
her sight obscured for
minute at a time by the
water but constantly paused and looked
to see that there
no one watching her
one of those pauses she
and cried out for
room the basin fell to the ground
and the water flowed to the feet
madame defarge by strange stern ways and
much staining blood those feet
coldly at her and said the
of evremonde where is she it
upon miss pross s mind
there were four in the room and
shut them all she then placed herself
the door of the
which lucie had occupied madame defarge
dark eyes followed her through
rapid movement and rested on
when it was finished
years had not tamed the wildness or
the grimness of her
her different way and she
madame defarge with her
every inch you might from your appearance
the wife of lucifer
miss pross in her breathing nevertheless you
not get the better of me
they two were at bay she saw
tight hard wiry woman before her as
lorry had seen in the same
a woman with a strong hand
the years gone by she
the family s devoted friend
madame defarge was the family s malevolent
towards the fatal spot where
compliments to her in passing i wish
see her i know that your intentions
depend upon it i
s words both were very
look and manner what the unintelligible
meant it will do her no good
will know what that means
me see her go tell her
i wish to see her
you hear if those
of yours were bed winches returned
pross and i was an
four poster they shouldn t loose
splinter of me no you wicked
woman i am your match madame
was not likely to follow
far understood them as to perceive
frowning i take no answer from you
let me go to her this with
angry explanatory wave of her
arm i little thought
miss pross that i
ever want to understand
truth or any part
it neither of them for
single moment released the other
eyes madame defarge had not
from the spot where
stood when miss pross
became aware of her but she
briton said miss pross i
desperate i don t care an english
for myself i know that
longer i keep you here the
ladybird i ll not leave a
of that dark hair upon
head if you lay
every rapid sentence a whole breath
her eyes this was a courage that
defarge so little comprehended
to mistake for weakness ha
you worth i address myself to
doctor then she raised
voice and called out citizen doctor
of evremonde child of evremonde any person
perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression
sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion whispered
three of the doors she opened
and looked in those rooms are all
are odds and ends
the ground there is no one
that room behind you

as madame defarge understood the
room they are gone

been in the streets from the first
tear you to pieces but i will
you from that door said
to keep you here while every
darling said miss pross madame defarge made
the instinct of the moment seized her
held her tight it
in vain for madame defarge
the vigorous tenacity of love always
much stronger than hate clasped her tight
even lifted her from the floor
the struggle that they
her round the waist and clung to
with more than the hold of
drowning woman soon madame defarge
said miss pross in
tones you shall not draw
i am stronger than you
up saw what it was
all this was in a second
the smoke cleared leaving an
woman whose body lay
on the ground in the first fright
passed the body as far
it as she could and ran down
she bethought herself of the

door again but she did go
and even went near it to
that she must wear these she
and locking the door
then sat down on the stairs a
moments to breathe and
cry and then got up and
away by good fortune
had a veil on her bonnet or
could hardly have gone along the streets
being stopped by good fortune too
woman she needed both
for the marks of gripping fingers
was torn and her dress hastily composed
ways in crossing the bridge she

her escort and waiting there

what if the door were
and the remains discovered what if she
charged with murder in the
of these fluttering thoughts the escort
is there any noise in the streets
and looked surprised by the
and by her aspect i don t

you say it was in vain

events she ll see
noise in the streets now
cruncher nodded his head i

a crash and that crash
the last thing i should
hear in this life blest if she
